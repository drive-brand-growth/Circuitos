# AI Copywriting Agent Skill
## World-Class Copy Generation Using Proven Frameworks

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Gap #1)
**Frameworks**: Russell Brunson + Eugene Schwartz + Alex Hormozi
**Purpose**: Generate world-class conversion copy for email, SMS, LinkedIn, and other channels

---

## Core Frameworks Integrated

### 1. Russell Brunson: Hook-Story-Offer (HSO)

**Structure**:
```
HOOK: Grab attention with pain point or bold promise
STORY: Build connection through relatable narrative
OFFER: Present solution with clear call-to-action
```

**Application**:
- Hook: First 1-2 sentences (subject line for email)
- Story: Middle section (2-4 paragraphs)
- Offer: Final paragraph with CTA

---

### 2. Eugene Schwartz: 5 Levels of Awareness

**Level 1: Unaware** (Don't know they have a problem)
```
Copy Style: Education-focused, problem revelation
Example: "Most gym owners don't realize they're losing $50K/year to this silent killer..."
Approach: Reveal the hidden problem
```

**Level 2: Problem Aware** (Know problem, not solution)
```
Copy Style: Problem agitation, solution teasing
Example: "Struggling with member retention? You're not alone. 68% of gym owners face this..."
Approach: Agitate the pain, hint at solution
```

**Level 3: Solution Aware** (Know solution type, not your product)
```
Copy Style: Solution positioning, differentiation
Example: "Personal training programs can boost retention 3x. But most gyms get it wrong..."
Approach: Position your solution as superior
```

**Level 4: Product Aware** (Know your product, not convinced)
```
Copy Style: Proof, social proof, objection handling
Example: "500+ gyms use our PT certification. Here's why it works..."
Approach: Build trust, remove objections
```

**Level 5: Most Aware** (Ready to buy, need push)
```
Copy Style: Direct offer, urgency, scarcity
Example: "Join now. 3 spots left. Money-back guarantee."
Approach: Close with urgency
```

---

### 3. Alex Hormozi: $100M Offers (Value Equation)

**Formula**:
```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort/Sacrifice)
```

**Maximize Value By**:
1. **Dream Outcome**: Bigger, specific promise
   - Not: "Get more clients"
   - But: "10 new personal training clients in 30 days"

2. **Perceived Likelihood**: Proof, credibility
   - "Worked for 500+ gyms like yours"
   - Testimonials, case studies, data

3. **Time Delay**: Speed to results
   - Not: "Eventually see results"
   - But: "First client in 7 days or less"

4. **Effort/Sacrifice**: Ease, convenience
   - "Done-for-you setup in 48 hours"
   - "Zero extra work on your part"

**Additional Elements**:
- **Scarcity**: "Only 10 spots available"
- **Urgency**: "Offer expires Friday"
- **Guarantees**: "Money-back if not satisfied"
- **Bonuses**: "Plus free $500 bonus training"

---

## Copywriting Process

### Step 1: Analyze Lead Profile

**Input Required**:
```javascript
{
  leadProfile: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    business: "MetroFlex Gym",
    industry: "Fitness",
    location: "Brooklyn, NY",
    pain_points: ["member retention", "revenue growth"],
    intent_signals: ["viewed GMB", "searched 'personal trainer'"]
  },
  lprScore: 78,
  awarenessLevel: 3, // Solution Aware (1-5)
  channel: "email", // email, sms, linkedin, facebook
  businessContext: {
    name: "Circuit Fitness",
    offer: "Personal Training Certification Program",
    price: "$497/month",
    guarantee: "10 clients in 30 days or money back"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Determine Framework Combination

**By LPR Score**:
- **70-100 (Hot)**: Most Aware (Level 5) + Direct Offer + Hormozi urgency
- **40-69 (Warm)**: Solution/Product Aware (Level 3-4) + HSO + Hormozi proof
- **20-39 (Cold)**: Problem Aware (Level 2) + HSO + Hormozi education

**By Channel**:
- **Email**: Full HSO structure, 200-400 words
- **SMS**: Hook + CTA only, <160 characters
- **LinkedIn**: Hook + Story emphasis, 100-200 words
- **Facebook**: Casual tone, Story emphasis, 150-250 words

### Step 3: Generate Copy Components

**Subject Line (Email) / Opening Hook**:
```
Technique: Pattern interrupt + curiosity + personalization

Examples:
- Problem Aware: "{{firstName}}, your gym is bleeding $4,100/month (here's why)"
- Solution Aware: "The PT certification that made MetroFlex $127K in 90 days"
- Most Aware: "{{firstName}}, your 10-client guarantee starts Friday"

Formula: [Attention Grabber] + [Specific Benefit/Intrigue] + [Personalization]
```

**Hook (First 1-2 Sentences)**:
```
Purpose: Stop the scroll, establish relevance

Structure: Pain point + Statistic/Bold claim

Example:
"John, 73% of Brooklyn gyms lose money on their PT programs.
But the ones who don't are making an extra $8K-$12K/month."

Why it works:
- Names the pain (losing money on PT)
- Uses local reference (Brooklyn)
- Provides contrast (losers vs winners)
- Quantifies outcome ($8K-$12K)
```

**Story (2-4 Paragraphs)**:
```
Purpose: Build connection, credibility, desire

Structure:
1. Relatable problem (I was there too)
2. Discovery moment (Here's what I found)
3. Transformation (Here's what changed)
4. Social proof (Others got same results)

Example:
"I talked to a gym owner in Park Slope last month.
Great facility. Amazing trainers. But only 12% of members
did personal training.

He didn't realize the problem wasn't his trainers.
It was how he was positioning PT to members.

We changed his approach. Within 30 days, he had 23 new
PT clients. That's $11,500 in new monthly recurring revenue.

Now 500+ gyms use the same system. Average results:
10-15 new PT clients in first month."

Why it works:
- Hyperlocal reference (Park Slope)
- Specific numbers (12%, 23 clients, $11,500)
- Relatable problem (positioning, not trainers)
- Social proof (500+ gyms)
- Quantified results (10-15 clients)
```

**Offer (Final Paragraph + CTA)**:
```
Purpose: Present solution, create urgency, call to action

Structure:
1. What you get (Dream Outcome)
2. Proof it works (Perceived Likelihood)
3. How fast (Time Delay)
4. How easy (Effort/Sacrifice)
5. Guarantee (Risk Reversal)
6. Urgency/Scarcity
7. Clear CTA

Example:
"Our PT Certification Program is proven: 10 new personal
training clients in your first 30 days, or we refund 100%
of your investment.

Setup takes 48 hours. We do everything. You focus on training.

500+ gyms. 4.8-star rating. $8K-$12K average monthly increase.

But we only take 10 new gyms per month. 3 spots left for November.

Ready to grow your PT revenue?

[Book Your Strategy Call] ← 15 minutes, no pitch, just value"

Why it works:
- Specific promise (10 clients, 30 days)
- Risk reversal (100% refund)
- Speed (48 hours)
- Ease (we do everything)
- Social proof (500+ gyms, 4.8 stars)
- Quantified outcome ($8K-$12K)
- Scarcity (3 spots left)
- Urgency (November deadline)
- Low-friction CTA (15-min call, no pitch)
```

### Step 4: Humanization Techniques

**Avoid AI Detection**:
1. **Vary sentence length**: Short. Medium length sentence. Then a longer, more conversational sentence that flows naturally.
2. **Use contractions**: "You're" not "you are", "Don't" not "do not"
3. **Add personality**: Inject brand voice, humor, empathy
4. **Imperfect grammar**: Occasional sentence fragments. Like this.
5. **Natural transitions**: "Here's the thing...", "Look...", "But here's what's crazy..."

**Personalization Tokens**:
```javascript
{{firstName}} // John
{{business}} // MetroFlex Gym
{{city}} // Brooklyn
{{neighborhood}} // Park Slope
{{pain_point}} // member retention
{{intent_signal}} // searched for personal trainers
{{competitor}} // Other gyms in Brooklyn
{{specific_stat}} // 73% of Brooklyn gyms
```

### Step 5: Generate A/B Variants

**Create 3 Versions**:
```
Variant A: Pain-focused (agitate problem)
Variant B: Benefit-focused (emphasize outcome)
Variant C: Proof-focused (social proof, stats)

Test across 100 sends each, measure:
- Open rate (subject line effectiveness)
- Click rate (offer appeal)
- Reply rate (overall resonance)
```

Hey {{firstName}}! 👋

Love what you're doing at {{business}}. Been following

## Awareness Level Copy Adaptation

### Level 1: Unaware (Reveal Problem)

**Subject**: "The $50K mistake 73% of {{city}} gym owners make"

**Hook**:
"{{firstName}}, I'm going to share something that might sting a bit.

Most gym owners in {{city}} are unknowingly leaving $50K/year
on the table. And they have no idea."

**Approach**:
- Reveal hidden problem
- Use shocking statistics
- Create "aha" moment
- Soft CTA (education, not sale)

---

### Level 2: Problem Aware (Agitate Pain)

**Subject**: "Struggling with {{pain_point}}? You're not alone"

**Hook**:
"{{firstName}}, 68% of gym owners struggle with member retention.

It's frustrating. You invest in equipment. Hire great trainers.
Run promotions. But members still quit after 3 months.

Sound familiar?"

**Approach**:
- Acknowledge the pain
- Show empathy (you're not alone)
- Agitate (make pain real)
- Tease solution (without revealing it yet)

---

### Level 3: Solution Aware (Differentiate)

**Subject**: "Why most PT programs fail (and how to fix it)"

**Hook**:
"{{firstName}}, you know personal training can boost retention.

But here's what most gyms get wrong: They treat PT like a
product add-on. It's not.

It's a relationship transformation. And that changes everything."

**Approach**:
- Acknowledge they know the solution type
- Differentiate your approach
- Educate on "why different"
- Build credibility

---

### Level 4: Product Aware (Build Trust)

**Subject**: "500 gyms. 4.8 stars. Here's why they chose us"

**Hook**:
"{{firstName}}, you've probably seen our PT Certification Program.

Maybe you're wondering: Does it actually work?

Fair question. Here's the data from 500+ gyms..."

**Approach**:
- Address skepticism directly
- Provide overwhelming proof
- Handle objections
- Show social proof

---

### Level 5: Most Aware (Close Now)

**Subject**: "{{firstName}}, 3 spots left for November"

**Hook**:
"Quick update, {{firstName}}:

We have 3 spots left for November's PT Certification cohort.

If you want the 10-client guarantee, claim your spot by Friday.

[Book Now]"

**Approach**:
- Assume they know everything
- Create urgency
- Remove friction
- Direct, no-nonsense CTA

---

## Hormozi Value Stack Implementation

### Dream Outcome (Make It Specific + Big)

❌ Bad: "Get more clients"

- "$11,500 in monthly recurring revenue by day 30"
- "34% PT adoption rate in 60 days"

---

### Perceived Likelihood (Proof Stack)

- 500+ gyms using it
- 4.8/5 star rating
- Average result: 10-15 new PT clients in month 1
- Featured in Gym Owner Magazine
- Money-back guarantee"
```

- "See improvement in first week"

**Comparison Framing**:
"Most gyms take 6 months to build a PT program.
We do it in 48 hours."

---

### Effort/Sacrifice (Make It Easy)

**Ease Indicators**:
- "Done-for-you setup"
- "Zero extra work"
- "We handle everything"

## Quality Standards

### Copy Must Pass These Tests:

**1. The 2am Test**
- Would your target customer say this at 2am?
- Or does it sound like marketing?
- If it sounds "professional", rewrite

**2. The Bar Test**
- Can someone remember the hook after hearing it once?
- If they need to write it down, too complex

**3. The Specificity Test**
- Count the numbers in your copy
- Minimum 5 specific data points per email
- "Many" = bad, "73%" = good

**4. The Differentiation Test**
- Remove your brand name
- Could this be from a competitor?
- If yes, add unique proof/story

**5. The Value Test**
- Apply Hormozi equation to your offer
- Is it 10x more valuable than price?
- If not, increase value or lower friction

---

## Forbidden Copy Elements

### ❌ NEVER Use:
- "Dear Sir/Madam"
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to reach out"
- "We provide innovative solutions"
- "Industry-leading"
- "Best-in-class"
- Generic subject lines ("Quick question")
- ALL CAPS (except strategic emphasis)
- Multiple exclamation marks!!!
- Wall of text (break into paragraphs)

### ✅ ALWAYS Use:
- Personalization ({{firstName}}, {{business}})
- Hyperlocal references ({{neighborhood}}, {{city}})
- Specific numbers (73%, $11,500, 23 clients)
- Social proof (500+ gyms, 4.8 stars)
- Concrete outcomes (10 clients, 30 days)
- Single, clear CTA
- P.S. line (most-read part of email)

---

## Advanced Techniques

### The Pattern Interrupt Subject Line

**Formula**: [Unexpected Statement] + [Specific Outcome]

Examples:
- "{{firstName}}, you're charging 47% too little" (shock + specific)
- "The $11,500 mistake I see every gym make" (money + specificity)
- "Why I'm giving away our $500 training (today only)" (curiosity + urgency)

**Psychology**: Brain notices pattern breaks, increases open rate 15-30%

---

### The "Slippery Slide" Story

**Concept**: Every sentence's only job is to get them to read the next sentence

**Technique**:
```
Short sentence to start. ← Easy to read

Then a medium sentence that builds curiosity. ← Momentum

Then a longer sentence that provides value but leaves a question
unanswered, which pulls them into the next paragraph. ← Hook set

Now they're invested. Keep sliding.
```

**Test**: Read your copy out loud. Does it flow? Or do you stumble?

---

### The Power P.S.

**Why It Works**: 40% of people skip to P.S. first

**Types**:
1. **Reinforcement**: "P.S. Remember, 10 clients in 30 days or 100% refund"
2. **Urgency**: "P.S. 3 spots left, offer closes Friday"
3. **Social Proof**: "P.S. That gym in Park Slope? 31 clients in month 2"
4. **Objection Handling**: "P.S. No long-term contract. Cancel anytime"
5. **Alternative CTA**: "P.S. Not ready for a call? Watch our 5-min demo"

**Rule**: P.S. should work standalone (assume they only read this)

---
