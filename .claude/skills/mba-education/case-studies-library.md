### 5. AI ROI Calculation Framework

**Formula**:
```
AI ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%

Total Benefits:
+ Revenue increase (new revenue, increased conversion, pricing power)
+ Cost savings (labor, efficiency, waste reduction)
+ Risk reduction (fraud, errors, compliance)
+ Strategic value (competitive advantage, market position)

Total Costs:
+ Development (talent, infrastructure, data)
+ Deployment (integration, change management)
+ Operations (compute, monitoring, maintenance)
+ Opportunity cost (what else could have been built)

Time Horizon: Typically 3-5 years
Discount Rate: 10-15% for tech projects
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
AI Customer Service Chatbot:

Benefits (Annual):
- Labor savings: $2M (20 FTE × $100K)
- Faster response: $500K (higher satisfaction → retention)
- 24/7 availability: $300K (off-hours support)
Total Annual Benefits: $2.8M

Costs:
- Year 0: Development $1M
- Years 1-5: Operations $200K/year
Total Costs (5-year NPV @12%): $1.72M

NPV of Benefits (5-year @12%): $10.08M

NPV ROI = ($10.08M - $1.72M) / $1.72M = 486%
Payback Period: 7 months
```
