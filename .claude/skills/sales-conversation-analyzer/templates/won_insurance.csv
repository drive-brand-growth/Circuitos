conv_001,"Agent: Hi Jennifer, thanks for reaching out about life insurance. Can I ask what prompted you to look into this now?

Customer: My wife just had our first baby and I realized I have nothing in place.

Agent: Congratulations! That's a big moment. Can I ask, if something happened to you tomorrow, how would your family cover the mortgage and expenses?

Customer: Honestly, I don't know. That's what's keeping me up at night.

Agent: I understand. Let's talk about what you'd need. What's your annual income?

Customer: About $85K.

Agent: And your mortgage and essential expenses per year?

Customer: Probably $65K total.

Agent: Okay, so general rule is 10x your income to replace your earning power, which would be $850K. But given your expenses, we could look at $500K to fully cover needs for 7-8 years while your child grows up. Does that feel right?

Customer: Yes, that makes sense.

Agent: Great. For a 30-year-old non-smoker, that's about $45 per month. Less than your phone bill.

Customer: That's it? I can do that.

Agent: Perfect. Let's get you covered. I'll need some health information to lock in this rate.",closed,500000,900,Jennifer Park,2025-01-10,David Kim
conv_002,"Agent: Hi Michael, I see you're looking at disability insurance. What's your current situation?

Customer: I'm self-employed and if I get hurt, I have no income.

Agent: That's a real risk. What would happen to your business if you couldn't work for 3-6 months?

Customer: It would probably fail. I'm the only one who can do what I do.

Agent: And financially, how long could you cover your bills without income?

Customer: Maybe 2 months with savings.

Agent: Okay, so there's about a 4-month gap between your savings and when you'd be in serious trouble. That's what we need to cover. What's your monthly take-home?

Customer: About $8K.

Agent: Perfect. We can get you disability coverage for 60% of that - $4,800/month - for about $180/month. If you're injured and can't work, you're covered after a 90-day waiting period.

Customer: That's a huge relief. I'll take it.

Agent: Smart decision. Let's get you protected.",closed,4800,720,Michael Torres,2025-01-14,David Kim
