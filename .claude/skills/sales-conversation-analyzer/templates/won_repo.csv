conv_001,"Agent: Hi Tom, I understand you need help recovering a vehicle. Can you tell me about the situation?

Customer: We have a borrower 3 months behind on a $45K truck. We need it back.

Agent: Understood. Do you have the current location of the vehicle?

Customer: Yes, it's at the borrower's residence in Phoenix.

Agent: Perfect. Our success rate in Arizona is 94% within 48 hours. Our fee is 10% of the vehicle value plus storage. For a $45K truck, that's $4,500 plus $50/day storage until you pick it up.

Customer: What if you can't find it?

Agent: No recovery, no fee. You only pay if we successfully recover the vehicle.

Customer: How fast can you move on this?

Agent: We can have a team there tonight. Usually recovered within 24-48 hours.

Customer: Let's do it. The longer we wait, the higher the risk.

Agent: Agreed. I'll need the VIN, borrower info, and your authorization letter.

Customer: I'll email that over in 10 minutes.

Agent: Perfect. I'll assign a team as soon as I receive it.",closed,4500,480,Tom Anderson,2025-01-12,Marcus Johnson
conv_002,"Agent: Hi Sarah, you need a skip trace and recovery?

Customer: Yes, borrower disappeared with a $35K vehicle. We have no current address.

Agent: How long has the borrower been missing?

Customer: About 3 weeks.

Agent: Okay, we can help. Our skip trace fee is $500, then recovery fee is 10% if we locate and recover. For a $35K vehicle, total would be $500 + $3,500 = $4,000 if successful. If we can't locate, you're only out the $500 skip trace.

Customer: What's your success rate on skips?

Agent: 78% within 2 weeks. We use database searches, social media, associates, workplace contacts.

Customer: Timeline is critical. Can you start immediately?

Agent: Yes. I need borrower's full name, SSN, last known address, and any associate information you have.

Customer: I'll send that now. Let's move on this.

Agent: You'll get daily updates. First report in 24 hours.",booked,4000,540,Sarah Mitchell,2025-01-19,Marcus Johnson
