- Brunson Hook-Story-Offer

## 🎯 The Problem with Generic Outreach

**Generic B2B Email:**
> "Hi [NAME], I noticed your gym has great reviews. MetroFlex is offering licensing partnerships. Are you interested in expanding?"

**Why it fails:**
- ❌ Doesn't identify AWARENESS STAGE (are they even thinking about expansion?)
- ❌ No Hormozi value equation (dream outcome, likelihood, time, effort)
- ❌ No StoryBrand positioning (you're pitching, not guiding)
- ❌ No Brunson hook (no pattern interrupt, no story)
- ❌ Treats all prospects the same (ignores ML-discovered features)

---

## 📊 ARI-Based Prospect Segmentation

### **Tier 1: Problem Aware (Score: 20-40)**
**Who they are:**
- Current gym owners feeling PAIN (overhead, churn, competition)
- NOT actively researching "expansion" or "licensing"
- Researching: "How to reduce gym overhead", "Gym profitability tips", "Fitness industry trends"

**Their awareness level:**
- ✅ Know they have a problem (margins squeezed, market shifting)
- ❌ Don't know licensing/expansion is the solution
- ❌ Don't know MetroFlex exists

**Hormozi Value Equation Applied:**
- **Dream Outcome:** Unsure (they want "more profit" but don't know HOW)
- **Perceived Likelihood:** N/A (haven't seen solution yet)
- **Time Delay:** N/A
- **Effort:** N/A

**Your Goal:** Move them from PROBLEM AWARE → SOLUTION AWARE

---

### **Tier 2: Solution Aware (Score: 41-70)**
**Who they are:**
- Gym owners actively researching expansion models
- Comparing: Franchising vs licensing vs opening 2nd location independently
- Researching: "Gym franchise cost", "How to expand a gym business", "Gym licensing vs franchising"

**Their awareness level:**
- ✅ Know they have a problem
- ✅ Know solution category exists (expansion models)
- ❌ Don't know MetroFlex specifically
- ❌ Don't know WHY licensing > franchising

**Hormozi Value Equation Applied:**
- **Dream Outcome:** Clear (want to expand, 2nd location)
- **Perceived Likelihood:** LOW (franchising is $300k+, risky)
- **Time Delay:** LONG (6-12 months franchise process)
- **Effort:** HIGH (franchise has heavy requirements)

**Your Goal:** Position MetroFlex as BETTER solution (higher value equation score)

---

### **Tier 3: Product Aware (Score: 71-100)**
**Who they are:**
- Heard of MetroFlex (brand awareness)
- Visited website, read case studies, maybe attended webinar
- Comparing MetroFlex vs other licensing models

**Their awareness level:**
- ✅ Know problem
- ✅ Know solution category
- ✅ Know MetroFlex exists
- ❌ Don't know if it's RIGHT FOR THEM (fit, timing, capital)

**Hormozi Value Equation Applied:**
- **Dream Outcome:** Very clear (MetroFlex licensing)
- **Perceived Likelihood:** MEDIUM (have seen proof but not convinced for THEM)
- **Time Delay:** MEDIUM (need to validate fit, get capital together)
- **Effort:** MEDIUM (concerned about complexity)

**Your Goal:** CLOSE THE DEAL (remove friction, stack value, reverse risk)

---

## 📧 TIER 1: Problem Aware Outreach (Hunger in the Wild, Score: 40-60)

### **Subject Line (Brunson Hook):**
> "The GLP-1 Crisis Killing Traditional Gyms (and the $4.1x opportunity it created)"

**Why this works:**
- Pattern interrupt: "GLP-1 Crisis" (they know Ozempic is affecting gyms)
- Curiosity: "4.1x opportunity" (specific number, intriguing)
- Relevance: "Traditional Gyms" (they identify with this)

---

### **Email Body:**

**[HOOK - Pattern Interrupt + Relate to Pain]**

[OWNER NAME],

The fitness industry just got cut in half.

Weight-loss gym seekers: **Down 41%** since GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic/Wegovy) went mainstream. If your gym was built around "lose 20 lbs before summer," that revenue model is dying.

But here's what nobody's talking about:

Serious lifters—the ones who want to get STRONG, not just skinny—are **up 67%**.

**The market didn't shrink. It shifted.**

And boutique strength training facilities are crushing it: **+156% growth** while big-box gyms declined 34%.

---

**[STORY - You're Not Alone, I've Seen This Movie]**

I talked to a gym owner in Arlington last month. Traditional 8,000 sq ft facility. Losing $12k/month.

He said: *"Members are canceling. They're taking Ozempic instead of showing up."*

I asked: *"What percentage of your members are serious lifters vs weight-loss seekers?"*

He said: *"Maybe 20% are lifters. The rest just want to lose weight."*

There's your problem.

---

**[AGITATE - The Hidden Cost of Staying]**

Here's what's happening to gym owners who don't adapt:

✅ **Overhead is killing you:** 8,000 sq ft = $28k/month rent + utilities + staffing
✅ **Churn is accelerating:** Weight-loss members are gone (Ozempic is faster)
✅ **Competition intensified:** Boutique strength gyms are stealing your serious lifters

The math doesn't work anymore. You can't out-discount Planet Fitness. You can't out-amenity Lifetime Fitness.

**But you CAN dominate the 67% growth segment: serious strength training.**

---

**[SOLUTION - The New Model (Hormozi Dream Outcome)]**

What if you could open a SECOND location—boutique, strength-focused, <5,000 sq ft—that costs **70% less overhead** and attracts the **4.1x higher-converting customers** (powerlifters, strongman, hardcore)?

That's what MetroFlex licensing is built for.

**Not a franchise. No $300k investment. No ongoing royalties.**

Just proven systems for boutique strength training gyms—from the gym that trained Ronnie Coleman for 8 Mr. Olympia wins.

---

**[VALUE EQUATION - Hormozi Framework]**

**Dream Outcome:** 2nd location generating $30k-$50k/month (boutique, strength-focused)
**Perceived Likelihood:** 83% success rate (vs 51% industry average for traditional gyms)
**Time Delay:** 90 days to open (vs 6-12 months for franchise)
**Effort:** Zero ongoing royalties, you keep control

**Value = MASSIVE**

---

**[STORYBRAND - You're the Guide]**

Here's the truth: You know how to run a gym. You've proven that.

But the MARKET shifted under you. It's not your fault. GLP-1 drugs changed the game.

MetroFlex isn't here to "fix" you. You're not broken.

We're here to show you the playbook for the NEW market: boutique strength training.

**You're the hero. We're the guide. The market is the villain.**

---

**[SOFT CTA - Low Friction]**

I'm not asking you to buy anything.

I'm asking: **Do you want to see the data?**

- Why boutique strength gyms convert at 4.1x
- Why <5,000 sq ft facilities have 156% growth
- Why cash-ready operators with existing space close at 89% (vs 52% without)

15-minute call. I'll show you the ML analysis we ran on 10,000+ gym licensing deals.

Zero pitch. Just data.

**Reply "SHOW ME" and I'll send a calendar link.**

---

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

P.S. The gym owner in Arlington I mentioned? He opened a 3,500 sq ft boutique strength facility. 4 months in, he's at 180 members paying $150/mo average. That's $27k/month revenue on $9k overhead. He's keeping his original location for now, but guess which one is thriving?

---

**[HORMOZI ANALYSIS OF THIS EMAIL]**

**Value Equation:**
- **Dream Outcome:** 2nd boutique location = $20k+ profit/month ✅ CLEAR
- **Perceived Likelihood:** 83% success rate + case study proof ✅ HIGH
- **Time Delay:** 90 days ✅ FAST
- **Effort:** "Zero royalties, you keep control" ✅ LOW

**Grand Slam Offer Elements:**
- Core: Licensing model (not franchise)
- Bonus: ML data analysis (free)
- Guarantee: Not yet (too early, Problem Aware stage)
- Scarcity: Implied (market is shifting NOW)
- Urgency: GLP-1 crisis is happening NOW

**PAS Formula:**
- **Problem:** GLP-1 drugs killing weight-loss gym model ✅
- **Agitate:** "Overhead killing you, churn accelerating, competition intensified" ✅
- **Solution:** Boutique strength training licensing ✅

---

### **Why This Works (vs Generic Email)**

**Generic:** "I noticed your gym. Want to expand?"
**ARI-Optimized:** Identifies they're PROBLEM AWARE, doesn't assume they know solution exists

**Generic:** Lists features (systems, support, brand)
**Hormozi:** Quantifies value equation (83% success, 90 days, zero royalties)

**Generic:** "Are you interested?"
**StoryBrand:** Positions them as HERO facing villain (market shift), you as GUIDE

**Generic:** "Schedule a call"
**Brunson:** Hook (GLP-1 crisis) → Story (Arlington gym owner) → Offer (show data, not sell)

---

## 📧 TIER 2: Solution Aware Outreach (Prospect Researching Expansion)

### **Subject Line:**
> "Franchising = $300k + 6% royalties forever. Licensing = $100k + $0 royalties. Here's why."

**Why this works:**
- Addresses their RESEARCH (they're comparing models)
- Specific numbers (not vague "better deal")
- Teases explanation ("Here's why" = open loop)

---

### **Email Body:**

**[HOOK - Direct Comparison]**

[OWNER NAME],

You're researching gym expansion. Smart.

You've probably seen franchise options: Anytime Fitness, Crunch, F45.

Let me save you $200k and show you the math.

---

**[WEAPONS vs FEATURES - Hormozi Language]**

**Traditional Franchise Model:**
- **Upfront:** $300k-$500k (franchise fee + buildout + equipment)
- **Ongoing:** 6-8% of GROSS revenue (forever)
- **Control:** Zero (they own the playbook, you execute)
- **Exit:** Restricted (need franchise approval to sell)

**Example: $40k/month gym**
- Gross revenue: $40k
- Franchise royalty (7%): -$2,800/month = **-$33,600/year**
- Marketing fee (2%): -$800/month = **-$9,600/year**
- **Total bleeding: $43,200/year** (forever)

**Over 10 years: $432,000 in royalties.**

---

**[THE LICENSING ALTERNATIVE - Value Equation]**

**MetroFlex Licensing Model:**
- **Upfront:** $100k-$150k (licensing + buildout + equipment)
- **Ongoing:** $0 royalties (you heard that right—ZERO)
- **Control:** You keep your brand, customize to your market
- **Exit:** Sell anytime to anyone (it's YOUR business)

**Same $40k/month gym:**
- Royalties: $0
- Marketing fees: $0
- **Total bleeding: $0**

**Over 10 years: You keep $432,000.**

---

---

**[SOCIAL PROOF - Hormozi Likelihood]**

> "We trained Ronnie Coleman for 8 Mr. Olympia wins. We know what elite performance looks like. MetroFlex licensing gives gym owners the same precision in operations that we demand in training. It's not software. It's a competitive weapon."

**Results (20+ licensees, 3-year track record):**
- 83% still operating (vs 51% industry average for gyms)
- Average time to profitability: 14 months
- Average ROI: 267% over 5 years

**Reply "SHOW ME THE MATH" and I'll send calendar link.**

---

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

P.S. The $432k you save on royalties over 10 years? That's 3.5 gym buildouts. You could open 4 locations with licensing for the COST of 1 franchise (when you factor in royalties). That's the compounding advantage.

## 📧 TIER 3: Product Aware (Visited Website, Considering MetroFlex)

### **Subject Line (Brunson Close):**

### **Email Body:**

**[DIRECT CLOSE - No Fluff]**

[OWNER NAME],

I saw you visited metroflexlicensing.com 3 times this week and downloaded the case study.

You're doing your homework. I respect that.

Before we jump on a call, I need to ask ONE question:

**Do you have $150k liquid cash available for this project?**

Here's why I'm asking:

---

**[QUALIFYING THEM - Sandler Approach]**

Our AI analyzed 10,000+ gym licensing deals. We found 8 factors that predict success.

**THE #1 FACTOR (0.42 feature importance - HIGHEST):**
**liquid_cash_reserves >$150k**

**Why it matters:**
- Cash-ready prospects convert at **3.8x higher rate** than SBA-dependent buyers
- No loan delays (banks take 90-120 days for SBA approval)
- No interest payments eating your profit ($200k SBA loan = $12k-$18k/year in interest)
- Flexibility for unexpected costs (permits always cost more than quoted)

**If you have $150k+ liquid:**
- You're a PLATINUM prospect (our highest tier)
- 89% close rate (you WILL succeed)
- We fast-track your market analysis (this week)

**If you have $50k-$150k liquid:**
- You're a GOLD prospect (strong fit)
- We help you structure equipment financing to preserve cash
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks to close

**If you have <$50k liquid:**
- You're not ready yet (and that's okay!)
- Save 6-12 months, then come back
- I'll send you a savings plan to get to $75k minimum

---

If MetroFlex doesn't save you 20+ hours/week in the first 30 days, we refund 100%. No questions.

**Performance Guarantee:**

**Plus:** You keep all equipment (Rogue racks, barbells, plates = $50k-$100k resale value if you decide to exit)

**[FINAL CTA - Assumptive Close]**

So, back to my question:

**Do you have $150k+ liquid?**

**If YES:** Reply "YES - PLATINUM" and I'll send market analysis calendar link (this week)

**One reply. That's all I need.**

---

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

P.S. You've done the research. You know the value equation is insane (83% success vs 51% average, zero royalties vs $40k+/year bleeding). The only question left: **Are you ready NOW or in 6 months?** Either answer is fine. I just need to know which path you're on.

---

**[HORMOZI ANALYSIS - TIER 3 CLOSE]**

**Why this email CLOSES:**

**1. Qualification (not pitching):**
- Asking about THEIR readiness (cash reserves)
- Positions YOU as the selector (Sandler approach)
- Makes them want to qualify (vs you selling to them)

**2. Value equation RECAP:**
- They've already seen the value (visited website 3x)
- Now we're just reminding them WHY they were interested
- No new information, just crystallizing decision

**3. Risk reversal STACKED:**
- 30-day money-back
- Performance guarantee
- Equipment resale value (downside protection)
- **ALL risk on you, ZERO risk on them**

**4. Clear next steps:**
- Not vague "let's chat"
- Specific: Market analysis → Licensing → Launch → Growth
- Timeline: 90 days to opening (urgency)

**5. Assumptive close:**
- "Before we move forward" (assumes they're ready)
- "Reply with your tier" (assumes they'll reply)
- "That's all I need" (low friction, just one action)

## 📊 Framework Comparison (Generic vs ARI-Optimized)

| Element | Generic B2B Email | ARI-Optimized Email |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Awareness Stage** | Ignores (treats all prospects same) | Tier 1 = Problem Aware, Tier 2 = Solution Aware, Tier 3 = Product Aware |
| **Hormozi Value Equation** | Absent (just lists features) | Quantified: Dream outcome, likelihood, time, effort |
| **StoryBrand** | Pitching (seller) | Guiding (helper), positions them as hero |
| **Brunson Hook** | Generic ("I noticed your gym") | Pattern interrupt ("GLP-1 Crisis", "$432k bleeding") |
| **Social Proof** | Generic ("we're great") | Specific (83% vs 51%, Brian Dobson, Ronnie Coleman) |
| **CTA** | Vague ("interested?") | Tier-specific: Show data (T1), Show math (T2), Qualify (T3) |
| **Risk Reversal** | Absent | Stacked: 30-day guarantee + performance guarantee + equipment resale |
| **Language** | Features | Weapons (Hormozi language) |
| **Urgency** | Absent | Market shifting NOW (GLP-1, boutique +156%, big-box -34%) |
