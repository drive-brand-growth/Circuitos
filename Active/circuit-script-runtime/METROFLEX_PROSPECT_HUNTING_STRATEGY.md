## 💡 Pro Tips from the ML Insights

### 1. **Lead with Cash Qualification (40% of score!)**
Early in conversation: *"Just to make sure we're a fit - do you have at least $150k in liquid capital available for this project?"*

If no → Disqualify or refer to SBA lenders
If yes → Continue qualification

### 2. **Prioritize Space Owners (89% conversion!)**
Prospects with space are 2x more likely to close. Ask early:
*"Do you already have a commercial space, or would you be looking for one?"*

Owned/long lease → Hot lead
Need to find space → Cooler lead

### 3. **Strength Training = 4.1x Conversion**
If they say "general fitness" or "cardio-focused":
*"Just so you know, MetroFlex is really built for hardcore strength training - powerlifting, strongman, Olympic lifting. Is that your focus?"*

If no → Probably not a fit (don't waste time)
If yes → Perfect fit (close rate 80%+)

### 4. **Social Media is Free Marketing (20% of score)**
If they have 5k+ fitness followers:
*"I noticed you have [X] followers. That's a huge advantage - most new gym owners spend $10k-$20k building that community. You already have it."*

This validates their value and increases close probability.

### 5. **Avoid Big Box Prospects (51% F1!)**
If they say "We're planning a 15,000 sqft facility":
*"Just to set expectations - MetroFlex licensing works best for boutique facilities under 5k sqft. The market has really shifted away from big box. Would you be open to a smaller, higher-margin model?"*

If no → Disqualify (save your time)
If yes → Great fit
