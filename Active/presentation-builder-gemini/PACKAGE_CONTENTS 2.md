## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User chooses format**: PowerPoint, One-Pager, or PDF Slick
2. **User provides context**: Audience, goal, key messages
3. **Gem generates blueprint**: Complete slide/page breakdown with design specs

**Result**: World-class presentations in a fraction of the time.

## ⏱️ Time Savings

### PowerPoint Deck (15 slides)
- **Traditional**: 8-12 hours from scratch
- **With Gem**: 2-4 hours total (10 min blueprint + 2-4 hours build)
- **Savings**: 60-75% time reduction

### PDF One-Pager
- **Traditional**: 4-6 hours
- **With Gem**: 1-2 hours total
- **Savings**: 70-80% time reduction

### PDF Sales Slick (8 pages)
- **Traditional**: 16-24 hours
- **With Gem**: 4-6 hours total
- **Savings**: 70-80% time reduction

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:
1. **Be specific**: Include audience, goal, duration, key messages
2. **Upload quality references**: Best presentations, brand guidelines
3. **Iterate incrementally**: Start with structure, then expand
4. **Use all three formats**: PowerPoint → PDF Slick → One-Pager

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Don't be vague**: "Create a presentation" (missing context)
2. **Don't upload bad examples**: Low-quality references = poor outputs
3. **Don't expect instant perfection**: Iterate based on your needs
4. **Don't forget your brand**: Upload guidelines for consistency
