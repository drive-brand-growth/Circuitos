## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Choose Format
Gem asks you to select:
1. PowerPoint/Keynote deck
2. PDF One-Pager
3. PDF Sales Slick

### Step 2: Provide Context
You share:
- Audience (who are you presenting to?)
- Goal (what action should they take?)
- Duration/Length (time or page count)
- Key messages (what must be communicated?)
- Reference materials (optional but recommended)

### Step 3: Receive Blueprint
Gem delivers:
- Complete slide-by-slide or page-by-page breakdown
- Headlines and body content
- Visual treatment descriptions
- Design system specifications
- Speaker notes (for slides)
- Build instructions

### Step 4: Build & Iterate
You:
- Build in PowerPoint/design software
- Request refinements ("expand slide 5", "make shorter")
- Generate alternative versions
- Apply your brand's visual assets

## 🚫 What This Does NOT Do

### Does NOT Create Actual Files
- Gem creates **blueprints**, not .pptx or .pdf files
- You build the presentation in PowerPoint/design software
- Think of it as an expert consultant + designer, not file generator

### Does NOT Replace Design Tools
- You still need PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, or design software
- Gem specifies what to build; you execute the build
- Can work with designers using Gem's specs

### Does NOT Replace Domain Expertise
- You provide the content, insights, and data
- Gem structures and designs the presentation
- Your expertise + Gem's design = world-class output

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:

**Be Specific**
```
Bad:  "Create a sales presentation"
Good: "Create a 15-slide sales pitch deck for VP of Sales at mid-market
       SaaS companies about our AI CRM, goal is to book a demo, emphasize
       60% admin time reduction"
```

**Upload Quality References**
- Your best sales deck (not mediocre ones)
- Current brand guidelines
- Templates you want to replicate
- Presentations that got great results

**Iterate Incrementally**
- Start with overall structure
- Then: "Expand slides 3-5 with more detail"
- Then: "Add data visualizations to ROI section"
- Then: "Create alternative opening"

**Use All Three Formats**
- Create full PowerPoint deck first
- Then: "Create a PDF sales slick version of this"
- Then: "Create a one-pager summary"
- Consistent messaging across all formats

### ❌ Don't Do This:

**Don't Be Vague**
- Missing audience, goal, or key message
- "Create a presentation about our company"
- Forces Gem to guess or ask many clarifying questions

**Don't Upload Bad Examples**
- Low-quality reference presentations
- Outdated brand guidelines
- Presentations that didn't work well
- Gem will learn bad patterns

**Don't Expect Instant Perfection**
- First output is a starting point
- Refine and iterate based on your needs
- Provide feedback to improve results

**Don't Forget Your Brand**
- Upload brand guidelines or specify colors/fonts
- Otherwise Gem creates generic (though professional) design
- Brand consistency requires brand input

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Gem doesn't ask for format choice
**Solution**: Re-paste GEMINI_INSTRUCTIONS.md, check "Step 1" section is intact

### Problem: Outputs are too brief/generic
**Solution**: Be more specific in requests, verify instructions pasted completely (600+ lines)

### Problem: Can't upload references
**Solution**: Upload during chat (not Gem setup), or paste brand specs as text

### Problem: Design doesn't match brand
**Solution**: Upload brand guidelines OR specify colors/fonts explicitly in prompt

### Problem: Wrong storytelling framework
**Solution**: Explicitly request: "Use Nancy Duarte framework" or "Use Problem-Agitate-Solve"

**More troubleshooting**: See [GEMINI_SETUP_GUIDE.md](GEMINI_SETUP_GUIDE.md) Troubleshooting section
