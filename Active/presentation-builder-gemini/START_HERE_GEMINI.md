## What This Gem Will Do

### When You Request a Presentation:

1. **Ask Format Choice** → PowerPoint deck, PDF one-pager, or PDF sales slick?
2. **Clarify Requirements** → Audience, goal, constraints, brand guidelines
3. **Analyze References** (if uploaded) → Extract design patterns, messaging style, visual treatments
4. **Apply Storytelling** → Nancy Duarte, Andy Raskin, Problem-Agitate-Solve frameworks
5. **Generate Blueprint** → Complete slide-by-slide or page-by-page breakdown
6. **Specify Design** → Colors, fonts, layouts, imagery, data visualizations
7. **Provide Build Instructions** → Ready to execute in PowerPoint/PDF software

**Result**: You get a complete, professional presentation blueprint that you (or a designer) can build immediately.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't skip format selection** → The Gem will ask you to choose PowerPoint/One-Pager/PDF Slick first
❌ **Don't expect it to create actual files** → It creates detailed blueprints; you build in PowerPoint/design software
❌ **Don't upload low-quality references** → Garbage in, garbage out; use your best presentations as examples
❌ **Don't forget brand guidelines** → Upload logos, color palettes, fonts if you want brand consistency
❌ **Don't skip testing** → Use GEMINI_TEST_PROMPTS.md to validate it's working correctly

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Upload Your Best Work as References
The Gem learns from your examples. Upload:
- Your highest-performing sales deck
- Your most beautiful presentation design
- Your most recent brand guidelines
- Any templates you want to replicate

### Tip 2: Be Specific in Your Requests
Instead of: "Create a sales presentation"
Try: "Create a 15-slide sales pitch deck for VP of Sales at mid-market SaaS companies about our AI CRM, goal is to book a demo, use a problem-agitate-solve structure"

### Tip 3: Iterate and Refine
First pass gives you the structure. Then ask:
- "Expand slide 5 with more detail"
- "Create an alternative version of the opening section"
- "Add more data visualizations to the ROI section"
- "Make the one-pager more visually dramatic"

### Tip 4: Use for Multiple Formats
Create all three from the same content:
1. Start with full PowerPoint deck (comprehensive)
2. "Now create a PDF sales slick version of this"
3. "Now create a one-pager summary"

### Tip 5: Combine with Your Design Skills
- Use the blueprint as your foundation
- Enhance with custom photography/graphics
- Apply your brand's exact visual style
- Add animations and transitions (for PowerPoint)
