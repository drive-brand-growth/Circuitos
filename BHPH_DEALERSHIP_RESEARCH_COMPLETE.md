## 4. PAIN POINTS SPECIFIC TO COLLECTIONS

### Monthly Delinquency Challenges:

- **Subprime Customer Base**: Near 10% default rate industry-wide

#### Time Spent on Locating Vehicles:
- **Manual Skip Tracing**: Hours per account
- **Traditional Methods**: Driving neighborhoods, stakeouts, informant networks
- **Repossession Timeline**: Days to weeks without LPR data
- **With LPR Data**: Same-day recovery possible

### Cost of Skip Tracing and Recovery:

#### Skip Tracing Costs Per Account:
- **Manual Skip Tracing**: $20 - $350 per account (depending on complexity)
- **Automated Services (Bulk)**: $0.10 - $3.00 per search
  - Basic online: $0.25 - $3.00 per query
  - Bulk searches: $0.10 - $1.00 each

- **Industry Constraint**: "Can't find enough repo men to meet demand"

#### Total Monthly Collections Expenses (200-Account Portfolio Example):
- 40 delinquent accounts @ 40% rate
- Skip tracing: 40 accounts x $50 avg = $2,000
- Successful repos: 8-10 vehicles x $500 avg = $4,000 - $5,000
- Storage: 10 vehicles x $30/day x 7 days = $2,100
- **Monthly Total**: $8,100 - $9,100
- **Annual Collections Cost**: $97,200 - $109,200

### Loss Ratios and Charge-Offs:

#### Financial Impact (200-Account Portfolio Example):
- Average loan balance: $6,500
- Total portfolio value: $1,300,000
- At 25% loss rate: $325,000 in annual charge-offs

- **Potential Annual Savings**: $130,000

#### Recovery Success Challenges:
- Vehicle prices surged from $30,400 (2019) to $38,761 (2024)

- Repossessions at highest rate since 2008-2009
- Economic pressures: inflation, insurance, gas, repairs

### Legal/Compliance Concerns with Recovery:

#### Federal Compliance Requirements:

## 5. WHY BHPH NEEDS LPR/VEHICLE LOCATION DATA

### Current Methods for Finding Delinquent Vehicles:
1. **Manual Methods** (Without Technology):
   - Calling customer phone numbers (often disconnected)
   - Visiting last known addresses
   - Driving through neighborhoods looking for vehicles
   - Contacting references/family members
   - Stakeouts at known locations
   - Informant networks
   - Hiring private investigators

2. **Technology-Assisted** (Traditional):
   - GPS tracking devices (if installed)
   - Skip tracing databases
   - Public records searches
   - Social media monitoring
   - Address/phone database services

3. **LPR Data** (Modern Solution):
   - Automated license plate scanning network
   - Real-time location alerts
   - Historical sighting data
   - GPS coordinates with photos
   - National database coverage

### Why LPR is Critical:

#### Immediate Location Intelligence:
- **9 billion+ license plate photos** in DRN database
- **80 million new images monthly** captured nationwide
- **Same-day recovery** possible with instant alerts
- **Historical tracking** - see where vehicle has been spotted

#### Cost Reduction:
- Eliminates manual skip tracing time
- Reduces "looking for vehicle" hours
- Enables faster repossession (lower storage costs)
- Prevents charge-offs through early intervention

#### Improved Collections:
- **Psychological Impact**: Customers know vehicle is tracked
- **Payment Prioritization**: More likely to pay when trackable
- **Early Intervention**: Catch delinquencies before they become charge-offs
- **Faster Recovery**: Reduce days delinquent = reduce losses

#### Operational Efficiency:
- Automate skip tracing process
- Integrate with existing dealer management software
- Real-time alerts when vehicle spotted
- Streamlined repo assignment process

#### Compliance Benefits:
- Accurate vehicle location before repo
- Proper documentation of vehicle whereabouts
- Reduced illegal repossession risk
- Better audit trail for collections activities

   - Proof: Small dealers benefit MORE from loss prevention

#### Competitive Objections:
10. **"I already use [Competitor]"**
    - Response: What's your current recovery rate? (benchmark)
    - Differentiation: Show unique LPR coverage/features

11. **"I'll just wait for prices to come down"**
    - Reality: Every month waiting = more charge-offs
    - Urgency: Calculate cost of inaction (monthly loss rate)

12. **"None of my competitors use this"**
    - Reality: Competitors may already use GPS or LPR secretly
    - Competitive Edge: Be first in market to reduce losses

## 12. KEY INSIGHTS & TAKEAWAYS

### Critical Success Factors:

1. **ROI is Undeniable**: Even at $500/month, preventing 1-2 charge-offs pays for entire year
2. **Decision Made on Pain**: Dealers buy after bad month, not during good times
3. **Owner = Decision Maker**: For 80%+ of market (small/mid-size), owner approves
4. **Compliance is Rising Concern**: State regulations getting stricter = need better tools
5. **Integration is Non-Negotiable**: Must work with existing DMS or won't adopt
6. **Proof Over Promises**: Show real data, real dealers, real results
7. **Time-to-Value Matters**: Dealers need wins in first 30 days
8. **Support is Differentiator**: BHPH dealers want hand-holding, not self-service
9. **Pricing Psychology**: Small dealers think monthly, large dealers think ROI
10. **Referrals Drive Sales**: Tight-knit industry, peer recommendations crucial

### Common Misconceptions to Address:

**Misconception 1**: "BHPH is sketchy/predatory"
- **Reality**: Most are legitimate businesses serving underserved credit market
- **Message**: "Help your customers succeed while protecting your business"

**Misconception 2**: "High losses are just part of BHPH"
- **Reality**: Top performers have 10-15% losses, poor performers 25-30%
- **Message**: "Join the top 20% of BHPH dealers with world-class tools"

**Misconception 3**: "Technology is only for big dealers"
- **Reality**: Small dealers have HIGHER loss ratios, need tools MORE
- **Message**: "Level the playing field with enterprise-grade technology"

**Misconception 4**: "Customers will hate being tracked"
- **Reality**: Legal disclosure required; customers accept as condition of financing
- **Message**: "Customers actually pay MORE reliably when they know tracking exists"
