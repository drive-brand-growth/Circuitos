```

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** `node_modules` folder exists with ~50 packages installed.

---

### STEP 4: Create Environment Variables File (3 minutes)

**What this is:** Secret configuration (like your API keys) that won't be committed to GitHub.

#### 4.1 Create .env File

```bash
# Copy the example
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 4.2 Edit .env File

**Option A: Using nano (terminal editor):**

```

**You should see:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-ABcd... (your key)
```

**üîí IMPORTANT:** Never commit `.env` to GitHub (it's in `.gitignore` so you're safe).

---

### STEP 5: Test Locally with Vercel Dev (10 minutes)

**What this does:** Runs your API endpoints on your computer so you can test them.

#### 5.1 Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

**What you'll see:**
```
added 1 package in 3s
```

#### 5.2 Start Local Development Server

```bash
vercel dev
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Vercel CLI 33.0.0
? Set up and develop "~/projects/Circuitos"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope should contain your project?
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What's your project's name? circuitos
? In which directory is your code located? ./

üîó  Linked to your-username/circuitos
> Ready! Available at http://localhost:3000
```

**Answer the questions:**
- Set up project? **y** (yes)
- Link to existing? **n** (no, new project)
- Project name? **circuitos** (or whatever you want)
- Directory? **./** (current directory, press Enter)

**Wait for "Ready! Available at..."**

#### 5.3 Test Your First API Endpoint

**Open a NEW terminal window** (keep the first one running).

**Test Virtual LPR:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/virtual-lpr \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "signal_type": "website_visit",
    "signal_data": {
      "page_url": "/pricing",
      "location": {
        "city": "Arlington",
        "zip_code": "76011",
        "lat": 32.7450,
        "lng": -97.1180
      }
    },
    "business": {
      "name": "MetroFlex Gym",
      "city": "Arlington",
      "state": "Texas",
      "lat": 32.7357,
      "lng": -97.1081,
      "target_radius_miles": 10
    }
  }'
```

**What you should see:**
```json

  "success": true,
  "qualified": true,
  "detection": {
    "signal_strength": 85,
    "predicted_lpr_score": 78,
    "reasoning": "High-intent action from 1.8 miles away...",
    ...
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** If you see `"success": true` and `"qualified": true`, it's working!

**‚ùå ERROR: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"**
- Go back to Step 4
- Make sure `.env` file has your key
- Restart `vercel dev` (Ctrl+C, then run again)

**‚ùå ERROR: "Invalid API key"**
- Check Step 1.3 - make sure you copied the full key
- Key should start with `sk-ant-api03-`

---

### STEP 6: Test the Interactive Test Console (5 minutes)

**What this is:** A beautiful web interface to test all your APIs visually.

#### 6.1 Open Test Console in Browser

With `vercel dev` still running, open:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/test-lead-validation
```

**What you should see:**
- Beautiful purple/gradient page
- Title: "Virtual LPR‚Ñ¢ Test Console"
- 3 test cards:
  - ‚úÖ Test 1: High-Intent GMB
  - üìä Test 2: Website Visit
  - ‚ùå Test 3: Low Quality Lead

#### 6.2 Run Test 1 (High-Intent GMB)

1. **Click:** "Run Test" button on first card
2. **Wait:** ~2 seconds (you'll see a spinner)
3. **Result:** Should show:
   ```
   ‚úÖ LEAD QUALIFIED

#### 6.4 Run Test 3 (Low Quality)

1. **Click:** "Run Test" on third card
2. **Result:** Should show:
   ```
   ‚ùå LEAD NOT QUALIFIED
   Signal Score: 25
   Reasoning: Low engagement from 30 miles away...
   ```

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** All 3 tests should complete with results showing.

**üì∏ SCREENSHOT:** Take a screenshot of the test results - you'll want this later!

---

### STEP 7: Test the Master Copywriter (5 minutes)

**What this does:** Tests the AI copywriting with 4 frameworks (Brunson, Schwartz, StoryBrand, Hormozi).

#### 7.1 Test Cold Email Copy Generation

In your second terminal window:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/copywriter \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contact": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "city": "Arlington",
      "custom_fields": {
        "lpr_score": 75,
        "distance_miles": 2.3
      }
    },
    "channel": "email",
    "awareness_level": "Solution Aware",
    "lead_source": "cold_email",
    "business": {
      "name": "MetroFlex Gym",
      "city": "Arlington",
      "state": "Texas",
      "type": "Hardcore powerlifting gym"
    }
  }'
```

**What you should see:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "copy": {
    "variants": [
      {
        "id": "A",
        "subject": "John - for serious lifters only",
        "body": "John,\n\nThanks for replying!...",
        "framework_used": "StoryBrand (build trust)",
        ...
      },
      {
        "id": "B",
        "subject": "...",
        "body": "...",
        ...
      },
      {
        "id": "C",
        "subject": "...",
        "body": "...",
        ...
      }
    ],
    "recommended_variant": "A"
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** You should see 3 variants (A, B, C) with different subject lines and bodies.

#### 7.2 Compare: Cold vs Warm Copy

**Now test with warm traffic (website visitor):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/copywriter \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contact": {
      "first_name": "Sarah",
      "custom_fields": {
        "lpr_score": 82,
        "distance_miles": 1.8
      }
    },
    "channel": "email",
    "awareness_level": "Product Aware",
    "lead_source": "website_traffic",
    "business": {
      "name": "MetroFlex Gym",
      "city": "Arlington",
      "state": "Texas"
    }
  }'
```

**Notice the difference:**
- **Cold email** body starts with: "Thanks for replying..." (humble, respectful)
- **Website traffic** body starts with: "Saw you on our site..." (confident, direct)

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** Tone should be noticeably different between cold and warm.

---

### STEP 8: Understand What You Just Tested (5 minutes)

**Let's break down what's happening:**

#### 8.1 The Flow You Just Tested

```
1. Lead signal comes in (website visit, GMB action, email reply)
   ‚Üì
2. Virtual LPR API (/api/virtual-lpr)
   - Validates: Is this lead qualified?
   - Enriches: Distance, demographics (Census data)
   - Scores: 0-100 based on fit, intent, timing
   ‚Üì
3. Lead Router API (/api/lead-router)
   - Detects: Cold email or website traffic?
   - Routes: Path 1 (cold) or Path 2 (warm)
   ‚Üì
4. Master Copywriter API (/api/copywriter)
   - Selects framework: Brunson, Schwartz, StoryBrand, or Hormozi
   - Adapts tone: Humble (cold) or confident (warm)
   - Generates: 3 A/B/C variants
   ‚Üì
5. Result: Personalized copy ready to send
```

#### 8.2 The 4 Copywriting Frameworks

Your system automatically chooses:

| Framework | When Used | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Brunson** | Product Aware (61-80 LPR) | Hook-Story-Offer: "Tired of gyms where..." |
| **Schwartz** | Any awareness level | Awareness-based: "You might not know..." |
| **StoryBrand** | Cold emails, Solution Aware | Hero's journey: "You're a serious lifter..." |
| **Hormozi** | Most Aware (81-100 LPR) | Value equation: "$60/mo, PR in 30 days..." |

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** You understand the flow from lead signal ‚Üí validation ‚Üí copy generation.

## üîó PHASE 3: GHL Integration (45 minutes)

**Goal:** Connect your APIs to GoHighLevel so leads automatically get validated and personalized copy.

---

### STEP 12: Understand GHL Workflow Structure (5 minutes - READ THIS)

**Before we build, understand what you're creating:**

#### Path 1: Cold Email Leads (Instantly.ai)
```
Instantly sends email
  ‚Üì
Lead replies
  ‚Üì
Instantly webhook ‚Üí /api/instantly-webhook
  ‚Üì
IF qualified ‚Üí Create GHL contact
  ‚Üì
GHL Workflow: "Cold Email Reply Handler"
  ‚Üì
Calls /api/copywriter (lead_source: cold_email)
  ‚Üì
Sends personalized follow-up
```

#### Path 2: Website Traffic Leads
```
Lead visits website/GMB
  ‚Üì
GHL Workflow: "Virtual LPR - Lead Validator"
  ‚Üì
Calls /api/virtual-lpr
  ‚Üì
IF qualified ‚Üí Update GHL contact
  ‚Üì
Calls /api/copywriter (lead_source: website_traffic)
  ‚Üì
Sends personalized email
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Path 1:** Humble, builds trust ("Thanks for replying...")
- **Path 2:** Confident, direct ("Saw you on our site...")

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** You understand we're building 2 separate workflows.

## üß™ PHASE 4: Testing & Verification (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Make sure everything works correctly before going live.

---

### STEP 18: Test Different Scenarios (10 minutes)

**Test these scenarios to verify your system adapts:**

#### Scenario 1: Close Lead (High Score)

**Create contact:**
- Name: Marcus Johnson
- City: Arlington
- ZIP: 76011 (same city as business)

**Add tag:** `vLPR`

**Expected Result:**
- `vlpr_score`: 75-85
- `distance_miles`: <3
- Copy tone: Urgent, mentions distance

#### Scenario 2: Far Lead (Lower Score)

**Create contact:**
- Name: David Chen
- City: Dallas
- ZIP: 75201 (30 miles away)

**Add tag:** `vLPR`

**Expected Result:**
- `vlpr_score`: 40-50 (or NOT qualified)
- `distance_miles`: ~30
- If qualified: Copy emphasizes "worth the drive"

#### Scenario 3: Different Income Area

**Create contact:**
- Name: Lisa Wong
- ZIP: 76002 (different income demographics)

**Add tag:** `vLPR`

**Expected Result:**
- `median_income`: Different from first test
- Copy should adapt slightly (if implemented)

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** System gives different scores based on location.

---

### STEP 19: Verify Framework Routing (5 minutes)

**Test that different awareness levels use different frameworks:**

#### Test: Solution Aware (Should use StoryBrand)

In your workflow, temporarily change this line in copywriter webhook:
```json
"awareness_level": "Solution Aware"
```

**Run workflow, check copy:**
- Should have hero's journey elements
- Should position business as "guide"
- Should have empathy statements

#### Test: Most Aware (Should use Hormozi)

Change to:
```json
"awareness_level": "Most Aware"
```

**Run workflow, check copy:**
- Should be very direct
- Should emphasize value equation
- Should have urgency/scarcity

**‚úÖ CHECKPOINT:** Copy tone and structure changes with awareness level.

---

### STEP 20: Monitor and Debug (5 minutes)

**Learn how to see what's happening:**

#### 20.1 View GHL Workflow History

**Navigation:**
```
Workflows ‚Üí Your Workflow ‚Üí History tab
```

**You see:**

## üìã PHASE 5: Going Live (Optional - When Ready)

**Do this when you're ready for real leads:**

---

### STEP 21: Connect to Real Lead Sources

#### Option A: Website Form

In your website form submission handler:
- Add tag `vLPR` to new contacts
- Workflow will auto-run

#### Option B: GMB Webhook

Set up GMB webhook to call your API directly:
```
https://your-url.vercel.app/api/virtual-lpr
```

#### Option C: Manual Testing

Add `vLPR` tag manually to real contacts to test before automation.

---

### STEP 22: Monitor Performance (Ongoing)

**First Week:**
- Check workflow execution rate: 90%+ success
- Check qualification rate: ~20-30% qualified (normal)
- Review generated copy quality
- Adjust awareness levels if needed

**Metrics to Track:**
```
Total leads ‚Üí Virtual LPR ‚Üí Qualified ‚Üí Copy generated ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Replied
