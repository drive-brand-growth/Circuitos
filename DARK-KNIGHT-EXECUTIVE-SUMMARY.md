## 2. DARK KNIGHT COLOR SYSTEM

### Batman-Inspired Professional Palette

**Primary Colors:**
```css
--gotham-black: #000000      /* Pure black - command presence */

--shadow-gray: #141415       /* Dark gray - subtle contrast */
--steel-gray: #1E1E20        /* Medium dark - structure */
--armor-gray: #2A2A2D        /* Card backgrounds - protection */
```

**Gold Accents (Minimal, Luxurious):**
```css
--gold-primary: #D4AF37      /* Rich gold - primary accent */
--gold-dark: #B8941E         /* Deep gold - shadows/depth */
--gold-light: #E5C158        /* Light gold - highlights */
--gold-glow: rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.3)  /* Subtle glow effect */
```

**Typography & UI:**
```css
--white-pure: #FFFFFF        /* Primary text */
--white-soft: #F5F5F5        /* Secondary text */

- ❌ NO bright colors (professional restraint)
- ✓ Only subtle gold accents (luxury minimalism)

**Color Psychology:**
- Black = Power, sophistication, authority
- Gold = Luxury, success, premium quality
