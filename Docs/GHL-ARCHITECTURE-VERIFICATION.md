## ❌ WHAT WE DON'T USE

### N8N: NOT NEEDED
- ❌ No N8N workflows
- ❌ No N8N database
- ❌ No N8N automation

**Why:** GoHighLevel has native workflow automation that's more powerful and integrated.

### Instantly Database: NOT USED FOR STORAGE
- ❌ Don't upload contacts to Instantly database
- ❌ Don't manage campaigns in Instantly UI
- ✅ ONLY use Instantly API to send emails programmatically

**Why:** All lead data lives in GoHighLevel CRM only.

---

## ✅ GOHI GHLEVEL AS SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### GHL Components We Use

#### 1. GHL CRM (Database)
**Primary storage for:**
- All lead data (contact info, demographics, psychographics)
- LPR scores (0-100)
- Engagement history (emails, SMS, calls, LinkedIn)
- Conversation transcripts
- Deal pipeline data
- Custom fields (200+ attributes)

**Upload Method:**
```javascript
// Direct API upload to GHL after enrichment
const contact = {
  firstName: lead.firstName,
  lastName: lead.lastName,
  email: lead.email,
  phone: lead.phone,

  // Custom fields (Virtual LPR data)
  customFields: {
    lprScore: 78,
    distance: '1.2 miles',
    neighborhood: 'Park Slope',
    medianIncome: 127400,
    intentSignal: 'Called business',
    awarenessLevel: 'Most Aware',
    // ... 190+ more attributes
  }
};

// Upload to GHL
await ghl.contacts.create(contact);
```

#### 2. GHL AI Workflows
**Replaces N8N for all automation:**

**Example Workflow:**
```
Trigger: New Contact Added to GHL
    ↓
Action: Call AI Employee "Lead Scorer"
    ↓
AI Employee runs: vlpr-lead-scoring-engine
    ↓
Action: Update Custom Field "LPR Score"
    ↓
Condition: IF LPR Score ≥ 70
    ↓
    Yes → Trigger Workflow "Cold Email Sequence"
    No → Trigger Workflow "Nurture Sequence"
```

**Cold Email Sequence Workflow:**
```
Trigger: High-Score Lead (≥70)
    ↓
Action: Call AI Employee "Copywriter"
    ↓
AI Employee runs: ai-copywriting-agent
    ↓
Action: Store generated copy in GHL custom field
    ↓
Action: Call Instantly.ai API (send email)
    ↓
Wait for Reply (webhook from Instantly → GHL)
    ↓
Condition: IF Reply in 48 hours
    ↓
    Yes → Mark as "Replied" → Assign to Sales Rep
    No → Continue Sequence (Follow-up #2)
```

#### 3. GHL AI Employees
**Each Claude skill = One GHL AI Employee:**

| AI Employee Name | Claude Skill | Purpose |
|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Lead Scorer** | vlpr-lead-scoring-engine | Score incoming leads 0-100 |

**How AI Employees are Called:**
```
GHL Workflow Step: "AI Employee Action"
    ↓
Select AI Employee: "Lead Scorer"
    ↓
Pass Context: {
  contactId: {{contact.id}},
  contactData: {{contact.customFields}},
  business: {{account.settings}}
}
    ↓

    ↓
Returns result to GHL workflow
    ↓
GHL workflow continues with result
```

#### 4. GHL Custom Fields (200+ Attributes)
**Virtual LPR data stored as custom fields:**

```javascript
// Contact Custom Fields in GHL

## 🔄 COMPLETE DATA FLOW (GHL-Centric)

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Lead Detection (Virtual LPR)
```javascript
// Virtual LPR detects foot traffic near business
const virtualLead = {
  lat: 40.7589,
  lng: -73.9851,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  deviceId: 'anon_123'
};

// Enrich with MCP servers
const enrichedLead = await enrichLead(virtualLead, {
  googleMaps: true,    // Distance, neighborhood
  census: true,        // Demographics, income
  clearbit: false,     // (Not free, skip for now)
  linkedin: false      // (Not free until we have email)
});

// Upload DIRECTLY to GoHighLevel
const ghlContact = await ghl.contacts.create({
  ...enrichedLead,
  source: 'Virtual LPR',
  tags: ['vLPR', 'qualified']
});

// GHL Workflow auto-triggers on new contact
```

#### 2. Lead Scoring (GHL AI Workflow)
```
GHL Workflow: "New Contact Processor"

Trigger: Contact Created with tag "vLPR"
    ↓
Step 1: Call AI Employee "Lead Scorer"
    Input: Contact custom fields
    Output: LPR Score (0-100) + breakdown
    ↓
Step 2: Update Contact
    Set: customField.lprScore = 78
    Set: customField.scoreBreakdown = {...}
    ↓
Step 3: Condition Check
    IF lprScore >= 70 → Route to "High Intent Flow"
    IF lprScore 40-69 → Route to "Medium Intent Flow"
    IF lprScore < 40 → Route to "Nurture Flow"
```

#### 3. Cold Email (via Instantly API, NOT Instantly database)
```
GHL Workflow: "High Intent Flow"

Trigger: Lead scored ≥70
    ↓
Step 1: Call AI Employee "Copywriter"
    Input: {
      lead: contact,
      awarenessLevel: mapScoreToAwareness(78),
      channel: 'email'
    }
    Output: 3 email variants (A/B/C)
    ↓
Step 2: Store copy in GHL
    customField.emailVariantA = [generated copy]
    customField.emailVariantB = [generated copy]
    customField.emailVariantC = [generated copy]
    ↓
Step 3: Select A/B test variant (rotate)
    selectedVariant = getABTestVariant('A', 'B', 'C')
    ↓
Step 4: Send via Instantly API (NOT Instantly database)
    await instantly.sendEmail({
      to: contact.email,
      from: business.emailSender,
      subject: selectedVariant.subject,
      body: selectedVariant.body,
      trackingId: contact.id,  // For webhook later
      webhookUrl: 'https://ghl.com/webhooks/instantly-reply'
    });
    ↓
Step 5: Log in GHL
    Add Activity: "Email sent (Variant A)"
    Update: lastEmailSent = now()
    ↓
Step 6: Wait for Reply (48 hours)
    IF reply webhook received → End workflow, mark "Replied"
    IF no reply after 48hrs → Continue to Follow-up
```

#### 4. Omnichannel Escalation (GHL AI Workflow)
```
GHL Workflow: "Follow-up Sequence"

Trigger: No reply after 48 hours
    ↓
Step 1: Call AI Employee "Channel Manager"
    Input: {
      lead: contact,
      engagementHistory: contact.activities,
      currentChannel: 'email'
    }
    Output: nextChannel = 'sms', reasoning = 'Email not opened'
    ↓
Step 2: Condition - Next Channel
    IF nextChannel == 'sms' → Go to SMS Flow
    IF nextChannel == 'linkedin' → Go to LinkedIn Flow
    IF nextChannel == 'call' → Create Call Task
    ↓
Step 3a: SMS Flow
    Call AI Employee "Copywriter" (channel: SMS)
    Send via Twilio API
    Log in GHL
    ↓
Step 3b: LinkedIn Flow
    Call AI Employee "Copywriter" (channel: LinkedIn)
    Create Task for sales rep: "Send LinkedIn connection"
    (Manual for now - LinkedIn automation restricted)
    ↓
Step 3c: Call Flow
    Create Task assigned to sales rep
    Include: Call script, lead context, talking points
```

#### 5. Reply Handling (Instantly → GHL Webhook)
```

    ↓
Instantly webhook → GHL endpoint
    ↓
GHL Workflow: "Email Reply Handler"

    Re-score lead (intent just increased)
    Update lprScore (likely now 90-100)
    ↓
Step 4: Assign to Sales Rep
    IF high-value lead → Assign to senior rep
    IF standard lead → Round-robin assignment
    ↓
Step 5: Notify Sales Rep
    SMS: "New hot lead replied: [name]"
    GHL Dashboard: Task created "Follow up with [name]"
    Email: Lead summary + conversation history
```

## 💡 WHY THIS IS BETTER

### vs. N8N Approach

| Feature | N8N | GHL-Only |

| **Maintenance** | Update 2 systems | Update 1 system |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep (learn N8N) | Easier (GHL UI) |
| **Reliability** | Webhooks can fail | Native = reliable |

### vs. Multiple Databases

| Feature | Multi-DB | GHL-Only |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Data Consistency** | Sync issues | Always consistent |
