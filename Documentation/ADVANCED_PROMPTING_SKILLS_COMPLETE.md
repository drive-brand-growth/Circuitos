## 💡 Key Insights

### The Bottleneck Isn't the Model
> "The gap between mediocre and exceptional AI outputs isn't about which model you use—it's about how you structure prompts."

### Interface Design = Output Quality
> "The right prompting strategy can extract performance from a smaller model that exceeds what a larger model produces with naive prompting."

### Systematic > Ad-Hoc
> "The people extracting real value from AI aren't using better models—they're using better structure."

### Meta-Cognitive Layer
> "You're not teaching the model new skills—you're providing the scaffolding that lets it apply the skills it already has."
