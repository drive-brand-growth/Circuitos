           AGENTFORCE REPORTING SYSTEM - EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
                Lost Opportunity Reactivation Agent
================================================================================
Date: October 30, 2025  |  Prepared for: Executive Team


================================================================================
THE BIG PICTURE
================================================================================

The Agentforce system generates 5 reports that answer 5 critical questions:

1. "What should my reps do today?"       → Daily Dashboard (Sales Reps)
2. "Is the AI working?"                  → Weekly Scorecard (Sales Leadership)
3. "How do we improve?"                  → Monthly Analysis (Sales Ops)
4. "What's the ROI?"                     → Quarterly Revenue Report (Executives)
5. "Are messages on-brand?"              → Quality Audit (Marketing)


================================================================================
HOW DATA FLOWS THROUGH THE SYSTEM
================================================================================

STAGE 1: DATA COLLECTION (From CRM)
    The agent pulls fragmented conversation data from Salesforce:
    • Email history (may be incomplete - 2 of 8 emails missing)
    • Call logs from Dialpad (often just duration, no notes)
    • Task history (vague descriptions like "Follow up - timing")
    • Meeting notes (may only have subject line, no details)
    • Opportunity fields (close date, amount, stage, close reason)

STAGE 2: CONVERSATION SYNTHESIZER (Filling the Gaps)
    Missing data is reconstructed using 5 techniques:

    2A. CONTEXT ANALYSIS
        Examines surrounding activities to infer what's missing
        Example: "Email sent Mon, meeting Tue, contract sent Thu"
                 → Infers: Meeting likely discussed pricing/terms

    2B. HISTORICAL PATTERN MATCHING
        Compares to 1,000+ similar past opportunities
        Example: "SaaS deals with 'timing' objection + $100K size"
                 → Pattern: 68% reactivate in Q1 when budget resets

    2C. TONE & SENTIMENT EXTRACTION
        Analyzes language in available text for emotional signals
        Example: "We'll circle back in Q1" (neutral tone, timing issue)
                 vs "This isn't a priority" (negative tone, deprioritized)

    2D. TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION
        Detects signals that indicate reactivation opportunity
        Example: Prospect changed jobs (LinkedIn), new exec hired,
                 competitor had outage, company raised funding

    2E. GAP FILLING WITH PROBABILISTIC LOGIC
        Reconstructs missing pieces with confidence scores
        Example: No objection recorded → Analyzes last 3 emails
                 → 78% confidence objection was "BUDGET" not "TIMING"

    OUTPUT: Synthesized opportunity profile with confidence scores
        • Engagement Score: 75 (confidence: 82%)
        • Sentiment: 6.5/10 (confidence: 71%)
        • Objection Type: TIMING (confidence: 78%)
        • Decision Stage: CONSIDERATION (confidence: 85%)
        • Reactivation Window: 55-65 days (confidence: 88%)

STAGE 3: DUAL SCORING ENGINES (DMN + ML)

    ENGINE A: DMN (Decision Model & Notation) - Rule-Based Scoring
        Applies business rules in decision table format:

        IF Days_Since_Contact <= 30 AND Engagement >= 70
           THEN Score=95, Tier=HOT, Priority=P1

        IF Days_Since_Contact <= 60 AND Deal_Size > $50K AND Engagement >= 50
           THEN Score=80, Tier=WARM, Priority=P2

        IF Days_Since_Contact <= 90 AND Engagement >= 30
           THEN Score=60, Tier=LUKEWARM, Priority=P3

        ELSE Score=30, Tier=COLD, Priority=P4

    ENGINE B: ML (Machine Learning) - Pattern-Based Prediction
        Trained on 2 years of historical reactivation data
        Predicts: "What's the probability this opportunity will close?"

        Features analyzed:
        • Days since contact (28% importance)
        • Engagement score (31% importance)
        • Sentiment score (24% importance)
        • Deal size (11% importance)
        • Objection type (6% importance)

        Output: Reactivation probability (0-100%) + confidence (0-100%)

    HYBRID DECISION: Combines both engines
        • If DMN says HOT but ML says <40% → Downgrade to WARM
        • If DMN says LUKEWARM but ML says >70% → Upgrade to WARM
        • If both agree → High confidence decision
        • Tracks "Decision Reasoning" for audit trail

STAGE 4: LLM MESSAGE GENERATION (GPT-4 or Claude)
    Generates personalized reactivation email using:
    • Contact name, title, company
    • DMN tier (HOT/WARM/LUKEWARM)
    • ML probability and confidence
    • Synthesized objection type
    • Previous conversation history (even if reconstructed)
    • Best channel (email, phone, LinkedIn)
    • Best timing (Tuesday 10am, etc.)

    Prompt includes: "Write warm, professional email addressing their
    TIMING objection without being pushy. Reference our November conversation
    about implementation timeline. Offer case study showing faster rollout."

STAGE 5: QUALITY CONTROL & VALIDATION
    Every generated message is checked for:
    • Length (100-2000 characters)
    • Personalization (contact name, company name present)
    • Tone (no pushy language like "buy now", "limited time")
    • Call-to-action (includes question or clear next step)
    • Compliance (GDPR, CAN-SPAM requirements met)

    Failed messages flagged for human review before sending

STAGE 6: SALESFORCE ACTIONS & DATA CAPTURE
    System creates/updates records and captures outcome data:
    • Creates Task for sales rep with generated message
    • Updates Opportunity fields with all scores and decisions
    • Sets follow-up date based on priority (P1=1day, P2=3days, etc.)
    • Logs decision timestamp and reasoning
    • (Optional) Sends email automatically if configured

STAGE 7: OUTCOME TRACKING & FEEDBACK LOOP
    After message is sent, system tracks:
    • Did prospect respond? (Yes/No, time until response)
    • Response sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
    • Did opportunity reactivate? (moved back to active stage)
    • Revenue generated (if closed-won)
    • Time to close

    This data feeds monthly ML model retraining to improve accuracy


================================================================================
THE 5 REPORTS (WHAT GETS GENERATED)
================================================================================

REPORT 1: DAILY OPPORTUNITY DASHBOARD
    Audience: Sales reps, sales managers
    Frequency: Every morning at 8am

    Shows:
    • Total opportunities analyzed overnight (e.g., 347)
    • HOT opportunities (P1) requiring immediate action (e.g., 23 deals)
    • WARM opportunities (P2) to pursue this week (e.g., 56 deals)
    • AI-generated email drafts ready for review (e.g., 42 messages)
    • Potential pipeline value ($18.7M total, $10.1M expected at 54% rate)

    Sample output:
        TOP PRIORITY - Acme Corp: $125K deal, 89% reactivation probability
        Last contact: 28 days ago | Objection: TIMING | Best channel: Email
        Draft message ready: "Hi Sarah, reviewing our November conversation..."

    Impact: Reps start day knowing exactly what to pursue, no manual research

REPORT 2: WEEKLY PERFORMANCE SCORECARD
    Audience: Sales leadership, sales operations
    Frequency: Every Monday morning

    Shows:
    • Messages sent (156), responses (62 = 40% rate), reactivated (28 = 18%)
    • Revenue generated this week ($2.4M)
    • Model accuracy: DMN 72%, ML 68% (targets: 70%, 65%)
    • Channel performance: Email 43% response, Phone 36%, LinkedIn 25%
    • Week-over-week trends (response rate up 5pp, revenue up 26%)

    Critical insight: "When DMN and ML both score HIGH, reactivation rate
    is 71%. When they disagree, only 12%. System learns which signals matter."

    Impact: Early warning if AI degrades, validates system works as designed

REPORT 3: MONTHLY MODEL ANALYSIS
    Audience: Sales operations, data science team
    Frequency: First Monday of each month

    Shows:
    • False positives: Scored HOT but didn't convert (identifies why)
    • False negatives: Scored LOW but actually converted (missed opportunities)
    • Feature importance drift: Which signals are becoming more/less predictive
    • Synthesis confidence: How often gap-filling was correct

    Example insight:
        "ML underestimates reactivation probability for 'BUDGET' objections
        in Q1 by 14pp (predicts 28%, actual 42%). Root cause: Q1 budget
        resets not captured as feature. Recommendation: Add 'Quarter' as
        feature and retrain model. Expected impact: +8% accuracy improvement."

    Impact: Continuous improvement, system gets smarter every month

REPORT 4: QUARTERLY REVENUE IMPACT REPORT
    Audience: Executive team, CFO, board of directors
    Frequency: End of each quarter

    Shows:
    • Total revenue generated ($10.2M from 87 reactivated deals)
    • Average deal size ($117K)
    • System investment ($134K) and ROI (7,512% or 75x return)
    • Comparison to baseline (before Agentforce):
      - 8x more opportunities pursued (42 → 347 per quarter)
      - 2.25x higher reactivation rate (8% → 18%)
      - 8.5x more revenue ($1.2M → $10.2M)
      - 98% reduction in time per analysis (45min → <1min)
    • Top 10 deals (41% of total revenue)

    Strategic recommendation: "Expand to 3 additional sales teams.
    Projected impact: +$30M annual revenue at current performance."

    Impact: Board-ready ROI proof, justifies expansion investment

REPORT 5: CONVERSATION QUALITY AUDIT
    Audience: Marketing, sales enablement, brand team
    Frequency: Monthly (15th of each month)

    Shows:
    • Messages generated (198), passed QC (172 = 87%), failed (26 = 13%)
    • Top failure reasons: Missing personalization (46%), too pushy (31%)
    • Brand voice scores: Professional 8.7/10 ✓, Helpful 6.8/10 ⚠
    • Message approach performance:
      - Case study lead: 52% response rate (BEST)
      - Timing check-in: 38% response rate
      - Direct ask: 22% response rate (WORST)
    • Compliance status: Zero GDPR/CAN-SPAM violations

    Sample good message: Shows personalized case study approach
    Sample bad message: Shows generic, pushy approach with analysis

    Recommendation: "Generate 60% case study messages (up from 24%),
    reduce direct ask to 10% (down from 14%). Expected +8pp response rate."

    Impact: Protects brand, ensures compliance, optimizes messaging
