## ⚡ Token Optimization Techniques

### ✅ DO: Token-Efficient Patterns

1. **Use Haiku-first strategy**
   ```
   "Use Haiku to quickly explore [codebase/data]"
   ```

2. **Launch parallel agents**
   ```
   "In parallel: explore codebase + research docs + analyze data"
   ```

3. **Let agents cache knowledge**
   ```
   "Use Explore agent to map architecture" (saves repeated file reads)
   ```

4. **Batch related questions**
   ```
   "Analyze X, Y, and Z in one comprehensive review"
   ```

5. **Use specialized skills**
   ```
   "Use ghl-workflow-qa-agent" (vs manual testing)
   ```

### ❌ DON'T: Token-Wasting Patterns

1. ~~Sequential agent launches when parallel is possible~~
2. ~~Reading same files multiple times~~
3. ~~Using Sonnet for simple searches/validations~~
4. ~~Manual testing when QA skills exist~~
5. ~~Asking me to explain code I haven't read yet~~

---

## 🎬 Example Workflows

### Example 1: Token-Optimized Exploration
**Scenario**: Understand a new codebase

**❌ Token-Wasting Approach** (50K+ tokens):
```
You: "Read file A"
Me: [reads file A - 3K tokens]
You: "Now read file B"
Me: [reads file B - 4K tokens]
You: "How do they connect?"
Me: [re-analyzes both - 7K tokens]
[Repeat 5x...]
```

**✅ Token-Efficient Approach** (15K tokens):
```
You: "Use Explore agent (Haiku) to map the authentication system architecture"
Me: [Launches Haiku agent - explores multiple files - returns summary]
Me: [Presents synthesized architecture understanding - 3K tokens]
```

**Token Savings**: 70% reduction

---

### Example 2: Complex Project Management
**Scenario**: Build Salesforce Lost Opportunity Reactivation Agent

**❌ Ad-hoc Approach** (120K+ tokens, scattered execution):
```
You: "Build Salesforce agent"
Me: [reads random files]
Me: [asks clarifying questions]
You: [provides more context]
Me: [starts building]
[realizes missing requirements]
[refactors]
[manual testing]
[finds bugs]
[fixes]
```

**✅ Orchestrated Approach** (60-70K tokens, systematic):
```
You: "Use project orchestrator: Build Salesforce Agentforce agent for lost opportunity reactivation"

Me: [Activates project-orchestrator-agent]
Me:
  Project Type: Salesforce Agentforce + Lead Reactivation

  Agent Team:
    - salesforce-agentforce-builder
    - conversation-synthesizer
    - dmn-ml-llm-agent-builder
    - ai-copywriting-agent

  Execution Plan: [4 phases with quality gates]
  Token Budget: 65K

  Proceed? [Y/n]

You: Y

Me: [Systematic execution with parallel agents, quality gates, validation]
Me: [Delivers complete, tested system]
```

**Token Savings**: 42% reduction + higher quality

## 📊 Token Budget Planning

### Project Size Guidelines

| Project Size | Token Range | Approach | Example |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Tiny** | < 10K | Direct work, no agents | Fix typo, read 1-2 files |
| **Small** | 10-30K | Single agent, Sonnet OK | Add simple feature |
| **Medium** | 30-75K | Multiple agents, Haiku-first | Build workflow + testing |
| **Large** | 75-150K | Project orchestrator, heavy Haiku | Multi-system integration |
| **Enterprise** | 150K+ | Chunking + orchestrator | Platform development |

### When to Request Token Optimization

- You have > 3 tasks to complete
- Project spans multiple domains (Salesforce + GHL)
- You need comprehensive analysis
- Budget is a concern
- You want systematic execution

**Command**:
```
"Use token-optimized approach with project orchestrator"
```

## 🎯 Quality Control Checklist

### Before Starting (Use Project Orchestrator)
- [ ] Project type identified
- [ ] Skill team selected
- [ ] Agent models assigned (Haiku vs Sonnet)
- [ ] Execution plan created
- [ ] Quality gates defined

### During Execution (Automatic)
- [ ] Todo list maintained
- [ ] One task in_progress at a time
- [ ] Tasks completed immediately
- [ ] Token usage monitored
- [ ] Quality checks at milestones

### Before Completion (Use QA Skills)
- [ ] Requirements met
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Validation passed:
  - Salesforce: `salesforce-agentforce-builder` validation
  - GHL: `ghl-workflow-qa-agent` testing
  - AI Agents: `self-correcting-prompts` quality check
  - Skills: `skill-testing-framework` validation

---

## 🔧 Advanced Commands

### Force Specific Model
```
"Launch Explore agent with Haiku to quickly scan for [pattern]"
"Use Sonnet for deep analysis of [complex system]"
```

### Parallel Agent Execution
```
"In parallel:
  1. Explore authentication system
  2. Analyze database schema
  3. Review API endpoints"
```

### Skill Combination
```
"Use conversation-synthesizer + vl-pr-lead-scoring-engine + ai-copywriting-agent to build reactivation campaign"
```

### Token Budget Constraint
```
"Complete this task in under 30K tokens using Haiku-first strategy"
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Token Waste from Sequential Work
**Problem**: Asking questions one at a time
**Solution**: Batch questions or use project orchestrator

### Pitfall 2: Using Sonnet for Simple Tasks
**Problem**: "Read this file" → Sonnet reads it (expensive)
**Solution**: "Use Haiku to quickly scan [files]" (10x cheaper)

### Pitfall 3: Not Leveraging Specialized Skills
**Problem**: Manual validation of GHL workflows
**Solution**: "Use ghl-workflow-qa-agent to validate"

### Pitfall 4: Scattered Execution
**Problem**: No clear plan, tasks get missed
**Solution**: "Use project orchestrator" for systematic execution

### Pitfall 5: Redundant File Reads
**Problem**: Same file read multiple times across conversation
**Solution**: Launch Explore agent early to cache understanding

## 🎯 Your Current Token Budget: 200K per conversation

### Typical Project Costs
- **Small feature**: 10-30K (15% of budget)
- **Medium workflow**: 30-75K (37% of budget)
- **Large integration**: 75-150K (75% of budget)
- **Enterprise project**: 150K+ (use chunking)

### Token Monitoring
I'll show you token usage after each tool execution:
```
Token usage: 30275/200000; 169725 remaining
```

### When to Start New Conversation
- Token usage > 150K and more complex work ahead
- Context getting stale (old decisions no longer relevant)
- Project phase completed, starting new phase

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with orchestrator for multi-domain projects**: Saves 30-50% tokens
2. **Use "in parallel" explicitly**: Forces me to launch agents simultaneously
3. **Specify model when you know**: "Use Haiku" = 10x cheaper for simple tasks
4. **Leverage your 40+ skills**: They're pre-optimized token machines
5. **Ask for token estimate**: "How many tokens will this take?"
6. **Batch related work**: One comprehensive pass > multiple small requests
7. **Trust the agents**: They see full conversation context, no need to repeat
8. **Quality gates are automatic**: When using project orchestrator
