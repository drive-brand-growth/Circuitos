- Direct relationship with borrower
- Easier collections communication

**Indirect Lending (Dealer Channel):**
- Dealer originates loan, bank purchases
- 60-80% of bank auto lending volume
- Higher risk due to dealer incentives
- Faster portfolio growth
- Limited borrower relationship
- Dealer may handle initial collections
- **Key Risk Factors:**
  - Inflated vehicle values by dealers
  - Poor documentation quality
  - Inconsistent verification standards
  - Higher early payment defaults (EPD)
  - Potential dealer fraud or misrepresentation

**Portfolio Concentration Limits:**
- Indirect portfolio typically limited to 15-25% of bank capital
- Single dealer concentration limits: 2-5% of portfolio
- Geographic concentration monitoring required

#### Portfolio Sizes and Delinquency Management

**Typical Bank Auto Loan Portfolios:**

## SEGMENT 2: TITLE LENDERS

### 1. BUSINESS MODEL

#### How Title Lending Works

**Basic Structure:**
- Short-term secured loan using vehicle title as collateral
- Borrower retains possession of vehicle
- Lender places lien on vehicle title
- Loan amount: Typically 25-50% of vehicle resale value
- Repayment term: 15-30 days (with rollover options)

**Loan Origination Process:**
1. Borrower brings vehicle and clear title to lender
2. Lender inspects vehicle condition and value
3. Minimal credit check (primarily value-based underwriting)
4. Borrower signs loan agreement and title transfer documents
5. Lender files lien with DMV/state motor vehicle department
6. Borrower receives cash (typically same day)
7. Borrower retains vehicle and keys

**No Credit Check Model:**
- Title lenders typically do not check credit history
- Underwriting based solely on vehicle value and condition
- Appeals to borrowers with poor credit or no bank account
- Faster approval than traditional loans (often <1 hour)

#### Loan Sizes and Terms

**Typical Loan Amounts:**
- Average title loan: $700-$1,500
- Range: $100-$10,000 (depending on vehicle value)
- Loan-to-value (LTV): 25-50% of vehicle wholesale/retail value
- Some lenders go higher (up to 75% LTV) for newer vehicles

**Interest Rates and Fees:**
- Average APR: 300% (25% per month)
- Range: 100-500% APR depending on state regulations
- Origination fees: $25-$100
- Late fees: $25-$50 per occurrence
- GPS installation fees: $75-$150 (if required)

**Loan Terms:**
- Initial term: 15-30 days
- Rollover/renewal: Borrower pays interest, extends principal
- More than 4 in 5 loans are renewed on due date
- More than 2/3 of business comes from borrowers with 7+ consecutive rollovers
- Average borrower stuck in debt for 8+ months

**State Variations:**
- Some states cap APR at 36% (effectively banning title loans)
- Other states allow unlimited APR
- Loan amount caps vary: $2,500-$10,000+
- Term minimums/maximums vary by state

#### Default Rates and Recovery Needs

**Default Statistics:**
- **1 in 5 borrowers** (20%) have vehicle seized due to default
- Repeat borrowing trap drives defaults
- Borrowers often cannot afford single payment payoff
- Economic pressure (job loss, medical bills) triggers default

**Reasons for Default:**
- Inability to make balloon payment at term end
- Accumulated interest exceeds original loan amount
- Job loss or income reduction
- Medical emergency or unexpected expense
- Vehicle mechanical problems
- Borrower moves out of state

**Recovery Timeline:**
- Default typically triggers after 15-30 days past due
- Some lenders use GPS kill switches to disable vehicle
- Repossession ordered within 10-20 days of default
- Vehicle must be held 30 days in most states for borrower redemption

**Recovery Needs:**
- **Fast vehicle location:** 24-72 hours ideal
- **GPS tracking:** Many lenders install tracking devices at origination
- **Quick repossession:** Minimize depreciation and storage costs
- **Efficient auction/sale:** Recover as much value as possible

### 3. UNIQUE CHALLENGES

#### High-Risk Lending = Higher Defaults

**Risk Profile:**
- Borrowers with subprime/deep subprime credit
- Often unbanked or underbanked
- Limited income documentation required
- Value-based lending with minimal underwriting
- High likelihood of repeat borrowing (debt trap)

**Default Drivers:**
- 20% of borrowers default (1 in 5)
- Economic vulnerability of borrower base
- Balloon payment structure difficult to meet
- Predatory lending criticism leading to stricter regulations
- Borrowers may hide vehicle to avoid repossession

**Portfolio Management Challenges:**
- Predicting which loans will default
- Balancing aggressive collections with compliance
- Avoiding customer complaints to state regulators
- Managing public relations and reputation
- Pressure from consumer advocates and media scrutiny

#### Need for Fast Vehicle Location

**Why Speed Matters:**
- Vehicle depreciation: 1-2% per month
- Borrowers may intentionally hide vehicle
- Borrowers may sell vehicle despite lien
- Borrowers may move out of state
- Vehicle may be damaged or abandoned

**Location Technologies:**
- **GPS Tracking Devices:** Installed at loan origination
  - Real-time location data
  - Geo-fencing alerts if vehicle leaves area
  - Ignition kill switches (controversial, may be illegal in some states)
  - Cost: $75-$150 per device + $10-$20/month monitoring

- **License Plate Recognition (LPR):**
  - Cameras on repo trucks scan plates
  - Database of vehicles to be repossessed
  - Alerts when target vehicle detected
  - Passive scanning, no vehicle modification required
  - Cost: $500-$2,000/month for data access

- **Traditional Skip Tracing:**
  - Database searches (credit bureaus, utility records, DMV)
  - Social media investigation
  - Phone and email outreach
  - Field investigation (drive-bys of known addresses)
  - Cost: $25-$100 per skip trace

**Industry Best Practices:**
- Install GPS at origination for loans over $2,500
- Use LPR data for loans without GPS
- Real-time location updates critical
- Target: Locate vehicle within 24-72 hours of repossession order

**Challenges:**
- GPS devices can be removed or disabled by borrower
- Privacy concerns and state laws restrict tracking
- LPR coverage gaps in rural areas
- Cost of technology vs. loan amount
- Balancing tech investment with profit margins

#### Customer Relationship Management

**Dual Role Challenge:**
- Collections staff must collect debt aggressively
- But also offer loan renewals and retain customers
- Walking the line between pressure and service

**Communication Strategy:**
- Early outreach (before default) to offer payment options
- Text/SMS reminders (highest response rate)
- Phone calls (multiple attempts per day)
- Email and postal mail follow-up
- In-person visits to home/work (if allowed by state law)

**Retention vs. Recovery:**
- Lenders profit from loan renewals (interest-only payments)
- Recovering vehicle is costly and may not cover loan balance
- Goal: Keep borrower paying, avoid repossession if possible
- Offer payment plans, extensions, or reduced interest to cure default

**Customer Complaints:**
- Harassment allegations
- Wrongful repossession claims
- GPS kill switch complaints (stranded borrowers)
- Privacy violations
- Deceptive lending practices
- State attorney general complaints
- CFPB complaints (even in states where legal)

**Reputation Management:**
- Negative online reviews
- Media investigations of "predatory lending"
- Community advocacy groups protesting storefronts
- Legislative pressure to ban title loans
- Balancing profitability with public perception

#### Legal Compliance Per State

**Multi-State Operator Challenges:**
- Tracking 50+ different regulatory regimes
- Licensing requirements in each state (annual renewals)
- Different APR caps, loan limits, term restrictions
- Varying renewal/rollover rules
- State-specific disclosure requirements
- Examination by multiple state regulators

**Compliance Staff Needs:**
- In-house Compliance Officer for multi-state operators
- Legal counsel familiar with consumer finance law
- Training programs for store managers on state-specific rules
- Loan management software with state-specific rule engines
- Document management systems for multi-state compliance

**Enforcement Risks:**
- State financial regulator examinations
- Cease and desist orders for violations
- License revocation or suspension
- Fines and penalties ($5K-$100K+ per violation)
- State attorney general enforcement actions
- CFPB supervision and enforcement (for larger operators)

**Recent Regulatory Trends (2024-2025):**
- 15+ states revisiting lending laws since January 2025
- California, Nevada, Oregon tightening licensing requirements
- More states considering APR caps or outright bans
- Increased scrutiny of GPS kill switches
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau expanded oversight

**Specific Compliance Challenges:**

**Federal:**
- Truth in Lending Act (TILA) disclosures
- Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)
- Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
- CFPB UDAAP prohibitions

**State-Specific:**
- Licensing and registration requirements
- Maximum APR and fee limits
- Loan amount caps
- Term minimums and maximums
- Renewal/rollover restrictions
- Repossession process requirements
- Hold period before vehicle sale (typically 30 days)
- Surplus proceeds distribution to borrower

#### Recovery Speed Requirements

**Why Recovery Speed Is Critical:**
- Every day of delay = vehicle depreciation
- Storage fees accumulate ($25-$75/day)
- Borrower may damage or sell vehicle
- Longer timeline = higher cost per recovery
- Lower net recovery = higher charge-off
- Investor/lender funding partners demand fast recovery

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- **Target: Locate vehicle within 24-72 hours**
- **Target: Repossess within 3-7 days of order**
- **Target: Auction within 30-45 days** (after hold period)

**Traditional Repossession Timeline (Without Technology):**
- Day 1-7: Order repossession, send notice to borrower
- Day 8-30: Skip trace, field investigation, locate vehicle
- Day 31-35: Repossess vehicle
- Day 36-65: Hold period (30 days) for borrower redemption
- Day 66-80: Auction/sell vehicle
- **Total: 80+ days from order to sale**

**Technology-Enabled Recovery Timeline:**
- Day 1: Order repossession, GPS shows real-time location
- Day 2-3: Repossess vehicle
- Day 4-33: Hold period (30 days)
- Day 34-45: Auction/sell vehicle
- **Total: 45 days from order to sale**

**Financial Impact of Speed:**
- 80 days vs. 45 days = 35 days of depreciation saved
- Vehicle depreciation: 1.5% per month = 1.7% saved
- $10,000 vehicle = $170 additional recovery
- Storage fees saved: $25/day x 35 days = $875
- **Total savings: ~$1,000+ per recovery**

**Operational Metrics:**
- Recovery rate: 50-70% of outstanding loan balance
- Cost per repossession (with technology): $800-$1,500
- Cost per repossession (without technology): $1,500-$3,500
- Net recovery after costs: 30-50% of loan balance

#### ROI Expectations

**Small Title Lenders:**
- Payback period: 3-6 months
- ROI expectation: 200-400% annually
- Key ROI drivers:
  - Reduce time to locate vehicles by 50%+
  - Lower cost per recovery by $500-$1,000
  - Recover 10-20% more vehicles (fewer skips)
  - Save 5-10 hours/week of manual work per store

**Mid-Size Title Lenders:**
- Payback period: 6-12 months
- ROI expectation: 150-300% annually
- Key ROI drivers:
  - Increase recovery rate from 50% to 60-70%
  - Reduce days to recovery from 30 to 10 days
  - Lower storage fees by $500/vehicle
  - Improve collections cure rate by 10-15%
  - Reduce FTE headcount by 1-2 positions

**Large Title Lenders:**
- Payback period: 12-18 months
- ROI expectation: 100-200% annually
- Key ROI drivers:
  - Portfolio-wide recovery rate improvement (1-2% = $1M-$5M)
  - Operational efficiency (reduce cost per loan by $10-$25)
  - Reduced charge-offs (save $2M-$10M annually)
  - Competitive advantage (faster recovery than peers)
  - Regulatory compliance (avoid fines, maintain licenses)

**ROI Calculation Components:**

**Cost Savings:**
- Reduced storage fees ($25-$75/day x 20-30 days = $500-$2,250 per vehicle)
- Lower repo agent costs (faster location = lower search fees)
- Reduced skip tracing spend (GPS eliminates need)
- Fewer FTE staff needed (automation)
- Lower vehicle depreciation (faster recovery)

**Revenue Enhancement:**
- Higher recovery rates (60% vs. 50% = 10% more revenue per defaulted loan)
- More vehicles recovered (fewer skips)
- Faster auction turnaround (more loans available for new borrowers)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Avoid wrongful repossession lawsuits ($50K-$500K per claim)
- Reduce compliance violations ($5K-$100K fines)
- Lower charge-off rates (better for investor relations)

**Example ROI Scenario (Mid-Size Lender, 15 locations):**
- Portfolio: 5,000 active loans
- Default rate: 20% = 1,000 defaults/year
- Average loan balance at default: $1,500
- Current recovery rate: 50% = $750 per loan recovered
- Current cost per recovery: $2,500
- Net recovery: -$1,750 per loan (LOSS)

**With Vehicle Location Technology:**
- Recovery rate: 65% = $975 per loan recovered
- Cost per recovery: $1,200
- Net recovery: -$225 per loan (still loss, but 87% improvement)
- Total improvement: $1,525 per recovery x 1,000 = $1,525,000/year
- Technology cost: $100,000/year
- **ROI: 1,425% or 3-week payback period**

- Revenue per location (target: $650K+)
- Loan origination volume (new loans per month)
- Customer acquisition cost

#### Buying Behavior

**Decision Process:**
1. **Problem Recognition (Week 1):** Marcus sees monthly P&L, recovery costs killing profits
2. **Peer Research (Week 2):** Calls 3 other title lender owners, asks what they use
3. **Google Search (Week 2-3):** Searches "vehicle recovery technology title lenders"
4. **Vendor Outreach (Week 3-4):** Fills out demo request forms, takes 2-3 sales calls
5. **Demo & Evaluation (Week 4-6):** Watches demos, asks CFO to analyze ROI

7. **Decision (Week 8):** If ROI is clear and references check out, buys within days
8. **Implementation (Week 9-12):** Pilot at 2 locations, roll out to rest if successful

**Budget Authority:**
- Marcus approves all purchases over $5K
- CFO can recommend but Marcus decides
- Board of Directors (him + 2 partners) for purchases over $250K

**Evaluation Criteria (Ranked):**

4. **Integration (10%):** Must work with existing loan software (Vergent LMS)
5. **Pricing (10%):** Prefer flat monthly fee, avoid surprise costs
6. **Support (5%):** Responsive customer service, phone support

**Objections:**
- "How do I know this will actually work? I've been burned before."
- "My store managers are busy, they don't have time to learn a new system."
- "What if it doesn't integrate with Vergent? I'm not switching loan software."
- "I need to see proof this works for OTHER title lenders, not banks."
- "Can I try it at 2 locations first before rolling out to all 18?"
- "What happens if you go out of business? I can't risk my operations on a startup."
- "I'm worried about privacy lawsuits if we track people's vehicles 24/7."

**Influencers:**
- CFO/Controller (analyzes ROI, must agree it makes sense)
- Regional Managers (will have to use it, need their buy-in)
- Other title lender owners (peer recommendations are gold)
- Industry association (American Association of Private Lenders)
- Loan software vendor (Vergent rep says "This integrates well")
- Repo agents (if they recommend a location tool, he listens)

**Preferred Communication:**

- Industry conferences (AAPLC Summit, state lending conferences)
- Peer introductions (warm intro from another owner = instant credibility)
- Simple one-page ROI sheet (no 50-page white papers)
- Video demo (short, 10 minutes, show the product)
- Case study with actual numbers (e.g., "Owner increased recovery rate from 48% to 64%, saved $180K/year")

**Content That Resonates:**
- Case study: "How Arizona Title Lender Recovered $500K More in One Year"
- One-pager: "Vehicle Location Technology ROI Calculator for Title Lenders"
- Video: "3-Minute Demo: How to Locate a Vehicle in 24 Hours"
- Blog post: "Why GPS Devices Fail and What Works Better"
- Peer testimonial: Video of another owner saying "This saved my business"

**Red Flags That Lose The Sale:**
- Sales rep doesn't understand title lending (talks about banks)
- No title lender customers (only banks and credit unions)
- Complex pricing (per-transaction fees, hidden costs)
- Long contract (wants month-to-month or 1 year max)
- Requires expensive hardware (GPS devices for every vehicle)
- No trial period (wants to pilot at 2 locations first)
- Slow response times (if sales rep takes 3 days to reply, assumes support will be bad)
