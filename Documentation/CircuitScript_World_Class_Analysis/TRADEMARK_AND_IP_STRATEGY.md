# Circuit Script™ - Trademark & IP Strategy
## Budget-Conscious Protection for Solo Founder

**Your Question:** "What should we trademark and patent? I don't have a fortune to spend."

**Short Answer:** Trademark 2-4 critical names ($450-1,400), keep algorithms as trade secrets (FREE + most powerful), skip patents for now.

---

## 🏷️ What to Trademark (Prioritized by Value)

### Tier 1: MUST TRADEMARK (High ROI)

#### 1. Circuit Script™
**Priority:** 🔥 CRITICAL (the product name)
**Cost:** $225-350 (USPTO filing + attorney review)
**Class:** IC 009 (Software) + IC 042 (SaaS)
**Why:** This is your Salesforce Apex competitor. The name IS the brand.

**Defensibility:** HIGH
- Unique combination ("Circuit" + "Script")
- Not generic (doesn't just describe code)
- Trademark search shows no conflicts in software space

**Revenue Impact:** HIGH
- License to agencies: "$X/month for Circuit Script™ platform access"
- Competitive moat: Competitors can't use "Circuit Script"
- Brand recognition: "The Apex for GHL"

**Recommendation:** ✅ FILE IMMEDIATELY ($225-350)

---

#### 2. Virtual LPR™
**Priority:** ✅ ALREADY FILED (per your docs)
**Status:** Trademark filing Q2 2026 (from your IP docs)
**Cost:** Already budgeted

**Why it's valuable:**
- Core scoring algorithm (1,505 lines)
- Differentiator vs generic lead scoring
- License-able to other platforms

**Recommendation:** ✅ Continue filing process

---

### Tier 2: HIGH VALUE (Trademark if Budget Allows)

#### 3. Tondi Governance Enhanced™
**Alternative names:** "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" or "Circuit Security Protocol™"
**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH (your competitive security advantage)
**Cost:** $225-350 (USPTO filing)
**Class:** IC 009 (Security Software)

**Why:**
- **Original:** Tondi Governance (Nate's work) - 10 stages, 2,500 words, 5,000 tokens
- **Your Enhancement:** 17 levels, 300 words, 500 tokens (90% more efficient + 7 new attack vectors)
- **Unique value:** You ENHANCED it significantly (not just using it)

**Defensibility:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- "Tondi Governance" is likely Nate's trademark (don't use that name)
- "17-Level Judgment Protocol" or "Tondi Governance Enhanced" = YOUR enhancement
- Could file as "derivative work with substantial improvements"

**Revenue Impact:** MEDIUM
- Sell as standalone security product
- Upsell to Circuit Script customers ($X/month for enterprise security)

**Recommendation:**
- Option A: Trademark "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" ($225-350) ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Option B: Keep as trade secret (FREE, but less protectable)

**Legal Note:** Check with Nate if "Tondi Governance Enhanced™" requires permission. If yes, use "Circuit Security Protocol™" or "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" instead.

---

#### 4. CircuitOS™
**Priority:** ✅ ALREADY FILED (per your docs)
**Status:** USPTO filing Q4 2025
**Cost:** Already budgeted

---

### Tier 3: NICE TO HAVE (Trademark Later, Phase 2)

#### 5. Circuit Intelligence™
**Priority:** LOW (Phase 2 - after revenue)
**Cost:** $225-350
**Why:** Generic-sounding, harder to defend
**Recommendation:** ❌ Skip for now, use as tagline only

#### 6. DMN Protocol™
**Priority:** MEDIUM (if you file patents on decision logic)
**Cost:** $225-350
**Why:** Could be valuable if DMN (Decision Model and Notation) logic is core IP
**Recommendation:** ⏸️ Wait until revenue, then reassess

#### 7. Circuit Governor™
**Priority:** LOW (descriptive)
**Cost:** $225-350
**Why:** "Governor" is industry-standard term (Salesforce uses it)
**Recommendation:** ❌ Skip, too generic

---

## 💡 What to Patent (Be Very Selective)

### Patent Reality Check

**Costs:**
- **Provisional Patent:** $3,000-5,000 (buys 12 months)
- **Full Utility Patent:** $10,000-20,000 (takes 2-3 years)
- **Maintenance Fees:** $1,600-7,400 over 20 years

**Your Budget:** Limited (solo founder)

**Strategic Question:** Can you make $50K+ from this patent before competitors work around it?

---

### Patent Candidate 1: ML Feedback Loop Architecture
**What it is:** Self-improving AI agents that optimize based on engagement data

**Patentability:** MEDIUM
- Novel approach: Tactical prompt updates based on ML pattern analysis
- Prior art exists: ML optimization is common, but your specific architecture might be unique

**Value if granted:** HIGH
- Core competitive moat (self-improving agents)
- License to competitors ($X per customer)
- Defensible for 5-7 years (then workarounds emerge)

**Recommendation:**
- ⏸️ **Wait for revenue** (don't file now)
- **Keep as trade secret** (FREE, strong protection)
- **File provisional patent** ($3K) only if competitors emerge with similar tech

**Why trade secret > patent here:**
- Your ML models improve with YOUR data (can't be reverse-engineered)
- Patent would DISCLOSE your architecture (helps competitors)
- Trade secret protection lasts forever (patent expires in 20 years)

---

### Patent Candidate 2: Virtual LPR™ Scoring Algorithm
**What it is:** FIT (40) + INTENT (40) + TIMING (20) = 100 score

**Patentability:** LOW
- Prior art: BANT, MEDDIC, CHAMP scoring frameworks exist
- Your algorithm is a weighted combination (not fundamentally novel)

**Value if granted:** LOW
- Easy to work around (competitors can use different weights)
- Hard to detect infringement (scoring happens in their system)

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT PATENT**
- Keep as **trade secret** (FREE)
- Trademark "Virtual LPR™" ($225-350) ✅ ALREADY DOING THIS
- Protect the BRAND, not the math

---

### Patent Candidate 3: 17-Level Security Protocol
**What it is:** Tondi Governance (10 levels) + Your 7 Enhancements

**Patentability:** LOW
- Security pattern detection is prior art
- Your specific 17 patterns are valuable but not fundamentally novel

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT PATENT**
- Keep as **trade secret** (FREE)
- Trademark "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" ($225-350) ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Update patterns regularly (patents freeze your approach)

---

## 🔒 Trade Secrets (FREE + Most Powerful)

**What to NEVER disclose publicly:**

### 1. ML Feedback Loop Implementation
**Location:** `.claude/skills/ml-feedback-loop-architect/SKILL.md`
**Protection:** Keep internal, don't publish architecture
**Value:** ∞ (lasts forever, can't be copied)

**How to protect:**
- ✅ Keep code private (don't open-source)
- ✅ Use in production (generates proprietary data)
- ✅ Require NDAs from contractors/employees
- ❌ Don't publish blog posts explaining how it works

---

### 2. Virtual LPR™ Exact Scoring Weights
**Location:** 1,505 lines of scoring logic
**Protection:** Obfuscate in production code
**Value:** HIGH (competitive edge)

**How to protect:**
- ✅ Deploy as compiled bytecode (not readable source)
- ✅ API-only access (customers never see weights)
- ✅ Trademark the NAME "Virtual LPR™" but keep math secret
- ❌ Don't publish exact formula (blog posts can say "proprietary scoring")

---

### 3. 17-Level Security Patterns (Specific Regex)
**Location:** `circuit_script/runtime/security.py`
**Protection:** Compiled, not disclosed
**Value:** MEDIUM-HIGH (security advantage)

**How to protect:**
- ✅ Customers see "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" (brand)
- ✅ They get the protection (it works for them)
- ❌ They never see the actual regex patterns
- ❌ Don't publish the 17 specific patterns (blog posts can say "17 attack vectors")

---

### 4. Prompt Engineering Techniques (57 Skills)
**Location:** `/Users/noelpena/.claude/skills/` (34,357 lines)
**Protection:** Skill library stays internal
**Value:** VERY HIGH (accumulating competitive advantage)

**How to protect:**
- ✅ License OUTPUT (customer gets working agents)
- ❌ Never license SOURCE (prompts stay yours)
- ✅ White-label option (agencies get compiled agents, not prompts)
- ❌ Don't open-source skills (others will copy)

---

3. International trademarks (5 countries) ($3K-5K)
4. Full utility patents (2 years later) ($10K-15K)

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DON'T DO THIS** (ROI too low for solo founder)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Strategy (Steve Jobs Simplicity)

### Phase 1: Launch (Months 1-6)
**Budget:** $450-700

**Trademark:**
- ✅ Circuit Script™ ($225-350)
- ✅ 17-Level Judgment Protocol™ ($225-350)
- ✅ Virtual LPR™ (already budgeted)
- ✅ CircuitOS™ (already budgeted)

**Trade Secrets:**
- ✅ ML Feedback Loop (keep private)
- ✅ Virtual LPR exact weights (keep private)
- ✅ 34,357 lines of prompts (keep private)

**Patents:**
- ❌ None (too expensive, use trade secrets)

---

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 7-12, after revenue)
**Budget:** $1,500-3,000 (funded by revenue)

**Add:**
- DMN Protocol™ trademark ($225-350)
- International trademark (EU) for Circuit Script™ ($550-800)
- Copyright registration for Circuit Script source code ($85 one-time)

**Still skip:**
- Patents (unless competitor emerges with copycat)

---

### Phase 3: Scale (Year 2+, after $100K+ revenue)
**Budget:** $5K-10K/year

**Consider:**
- Provisional patent on ML Feedback Loop ($3K-5K)
- International trademarks (5 countries) ($3K-5K)

**Full utility patents:**
- Only if licensing becomes major revenue stream ($10K-20K each)

---

## 🚨 Legal Considerations

### 1. Tondi Governance Attribution
**Issue:** Nate created "Tondi Governance" (10 stages)
**Your contribution:** Enhanced to 17 levels + 90% token efficiency

**Options:**
1. **License from Nate:** "Tondi Governance Enhanced™" (requires permission)
2. **Rename entirely:** "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" (no permission needed)
3. **Attribute in docs:** "Based on Tondi Governance by Nate, enhanced by CircuitOS™"

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Use "17-Level Judgment Protocol™" (clean, no legal issues)
- ✅ Attribute Nate in technical docs (good faith)
- ❌ Don't use "Tondi" in public trademark (avoid conflict)

---

### 2. Salesforce "Apex" Comparison
**Issue:** You're positioning as "Apex for GHL"

**Legal status:**
- ✅ Comparative advertising is LEGAL ("Faster than Salesforce Apex")
- ✅ Can say "Apex-like triggers" (descriptive, not trademark infringement)
- ❌ Can't call it "Circuit Apex" (confuses with Salesforce trademark)
- ✅ "Circuit Script™" is distinct (no infringement)

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Marketing: "Like Salesforce Apex, but for GoHighLevel"
- ✅ Docs: "Apex-style triggers"
- ❌ Don't use "Apex" in your product name

---

### 3. Open Source vs Proprietary
**Current status:** Circuit Script is closed-source (correct)

**If you open-source:**
- ❌ Trade secrets lost (anyone can copy ML Feedback Loop)
- ❌ Competitive advantage erodes
- ✅ Community contributions (faster development)
- ✅ Adoption increases (more users)

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Keep Circuit Script proprietary** (core platform)
- ✅ **Open-source helper libraries** (SDK for custom triggers)
- ❌ **Never open-source** ML Feedback Loop, Virtual LPR weights, 17-level security patterns
