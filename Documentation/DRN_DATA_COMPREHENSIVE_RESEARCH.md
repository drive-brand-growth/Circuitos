## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### **Objection 1: "We already have a skip tracing vendor"**

**Response:**
"That's great - most of our customers continue using their existing skip tracer for public records data. What makes DRN different is our exclusive LPR data layer that no other skip tracer can provide. We're capturing 220 million fresh license plate scans every month from our proprietary camera network. When you combine our real-time vehicle location data with your existing skip tracer's public records, you're not replacing what you have - you're adding intelligence they can't provide. In fact, our data helps you validate which addresses from your skip tracer are actually current by showing where the vehicle is really being seen."

**Key Points:**
- Position as complementary, not competitive
- Emphasize unique data (220M monthly scans)
- Validation use case (score existing addresses)
- Not replacement, enhancement

---

### **Objection 2: "This seems expensive"**

**Response:**
"I understand budget is always a consideration. Let's look at it from an ROI perspective: Our customers see an average 193% return on their DRN investment. More specifically, if you're experiencing charge-offs, consider that the average subprime auto loan charge-off costs $8,000-$12,000 in lost principal and interest. If DRN helps you prevent just 2-3 charge-offs per month, it typically pays for itself. Plus, our customers recover up to 35% more vehicles and reduce days to recover by 50%, which means less depreciation loss and faster asset recovery. Would you like to run the numbers based on your current charge-off rates?"

**Key Points:**
- Reframe from cost to ROI
- 193% average ROI statistic
- Charge-off prevention math (2-3 prevented = paid for)
- Offer to calculate their specific ROI
- Recovery rate and speed improvements reduce losses

---

### **Objection 3: "Privacy concerns - tracking customer vehicles seems invasive"**

**Response:**
"That's an important concern and one we take very seriously. DRN only captures publicly visible license plates - the same information anyone can see driving down the street. We operate under strict compliance with the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) and maintain the same legal standards required of law enforcement and government agencies. We've been serving 300+ financial institutions since 2009 with zero privacy violations. Our data is used exclusively for permissible purposes under DPPA - locating collateral to protect lien interests. We also maintain 24-hour data center security and conduct regular access audits. Would it help to review our privacy and security documentation with your legal or compliance team?"

**Key Points:**
- Publicly visible data (legal defensibility)
- DPPA compliance (same standard as law enforcement)
- 16-year track record, 300+ customers, zero violations
- Permissible purpose under DPPA
- Security controls and audit capabilities
- Offer to engage legal/compliance team

---

### **Objection 4: "What if the data is inaccurate or outdated?"**

**Response:**
"Data accuracy is mission-critical for us because our customers make recovery decisions based on our intelligence. Here's how we ensure accuracy: First, we're collecting 220 million fresh scans every month, so you're getting real-time, current data, not static snapshots. Second, every scan includes a photo, GPS coordinates, date, and time stamp, so you can visually verify the vehicle and location. Third, our scoring system shows you sighting frequency and timeline - if a vehicle has been seen at a location 15 times in the past 30 days, you can be confident it's current. Finally, our customers have recovered 2.8 million vehicles using our data since 2009 - if the data wasn't accurate, we wouldn't have that track record. Would you like to see a demo of how the sighting frequency scoring works?"

**Key Points:**
- 220M monthly fresh scans (real-time data)
- Photo verification capability
- Timestamped, GPS-tagged data points
- Frequency scoring provides confidence level
- Track record: 2.8M vehicles recovered
- Offer demo to show data quality

---

### **Objection 5: "Our team doesn't have time to learn another system"**

**Response:**
"I completely understand - your team is already busy working accounts. The good news is that DRN integrates directly into workflows you're already using, so there's minimal disruption. Many of our customers integrate DRN data into their existing loan management or collections systems via API, so your team sees the vehicle location data right where they're already working. For customers who prefer batch processing, we can deliver data via file feeds that populate your existing tools. And for teams that want to use our platform directly, our interface is specifically designed for busy collections staff - most users are up and running in under an hour. We also provide training and ongoing support. Would it be helpful to see how we've integrated with other organizations using [their LMS/collections software]?"

**Key Points:**
- API integration into existing systems
- Batch file delivery option
- User-friendly interface (1-hour learning curve)
- Training and support provided
- Data comes to them, not vice versa
- Reference similar customer implementations

---

### **Objection 6: "We only check SCRA before repossession"**

**Response:**
"That's common, but it actually exposes you to significant risk. SCRA protections apply to all collections activities - not just repossession. This includes negative credit reporting, deficiency balance collections, and even interest rate charges. The law requires continuous monitoring because service status can change at any time due to deployments, activations, or separations. Here's the real risk: A single SCRA violation can result in fines exceeding $100,000, plus reputation damage and legal costs. Our Active Duty Alerts provide continuous monitoring and instant notifications if service status changes, so you're protected throughout the entire collections lifecycle. For most lenders, one prevented violation pays for decades of SCRA monitoring. Would you like to see how we've helped other lenders build a defensible compliance process?"

**Key Points:**
- SCRA applies beyond repossession (collections, reporting, interest)
- Status changes require continuous monitoring
- $100K+ violation risk vs. modest monitoring cost
- One prevented violation = years of service paid for
- Defensible process for regulators
- Offer compliance documentation review

---

### **Objection 7: "How is this different from [competitor]?"**

**Response:**
"Great question - there are a few key differences: First, DRN controls about 70% of the LPR market, which means we have the largest camera network and the most comprehensive data coverage. We're collecting 220 million scans per month and have billions of historical records - significantly more than any competitor. Second, we've been in business since 2009 serving over 300 financial institutions, so we have the longest track record and the most industry expertise. Third, our customers achieve an average 193% ROI and recover up to 35% more vehicles - those are verified metrics. Fourth, we offer tiered service levels from self-service skip tracing to white-glove Deep Skip investigations, so we can match the service level to each account's needs. Finally, we integrate with leading platforms like masterQueue and offer robust API access. Would you like to see a side-by-side comparison of data coverage or discuss specific capabilities you're looking for?"

**Key Points:**
- 70% market share (largest network)
- 220M monthly scans (data volume)
- Since 2009, 300+ customers (track record)
- 193% ROI, 35% recovery increase (verified results)
- Tiered services (flexibility)
- Integration ecosystem (masterQueue, API)
- Offer detailed comparison

---

### **Objection 8: "We've tried everything - nothing works on these borrowers"**

**Response:**
"I hear this a lot from lenders in the deep subprime space, and I understand the frustration. Here's what makes DRN different: Traditional skip tracers rely on public records - phone numbers, addresses, employment records. Sophisticated skips know how to avoid those data sources. But they can't avoid being seen. Every time that vehicle moves, there's a chance our camera network captures it. We're not relying on the borrower updating their address or using their phone - we're tracking the asset itself. Our customers working with the toughest skip cases see the biggest impact because we find vehicles other methods miss. In fact, we've recovered 2.8 million vehicles since 2009, many of which were considered 'unfindable.' For your most difficult cases, we also offer Skip to Repo and Deep Skip services where our team actively works the account for you, combining LPR data with private investigators and advanced techniques. Would you be open to trying DRN on a small batch of your toughest skip cases to see the difference?"

**Key Points:**
- Traditional skip tracing relies on borrower cooperation (phone, address)
- DRN tracks the asset, not the borrower (can't avoid being seen)
- 2.8M vehicles recovered (proof it works)
- Biggest impact on hardest cases (where others fail)
- Skip to Repo and Deep Skip for ultimate challenges
- Offer pilot on toughest accounts

---

### **Objection 9: "Do we have the technical resources to integrate this?"**

**Response:**
"That's a common concern, and the good news is DRN is designed to work with organizations regardless of technical sophistication. We have three primary integration paths: First, if you have API capability, we provide comprehensive API documentation and implementation support - our developer portal walks your team through every step. Second, if you prefer batch processing, we can deliver data via secure file feeds (CSV, XML, etc.) that your existing systems can consume - no API required. Third, if you want a fully self-service option, our DRNsights platform is a web-based interface that requires zero technical integration - your team just logs in. We also provide dedicated implementation support to help with whatever path you choose. Most customers are live within 30-60 days regardless of technical resources. Which integration approach sounds most compatible with your current environment?"

**Key Points:**
- Three integration paths (API, batch files, web platform)
- Works for all technical sophistication levels
- API documentation and developer portal available
- Batch files for legacy systems (no API required)
- Web platform for zero-integration option
- Implementation support provided
- 30-60 day typical timeline
- Ask about their environment to recommend path

---

### **Objection 10: "The account has already charged off - why invest more?"**

**Response:**
"I understand the instinct to stop investing in charged-off accounts, but let's look at the economics: If you have a $15,000 deficiency balance on a charged-off account, recovering even 30-40% of that deficiency provides significant value. Our Deep Skip service combines LPR data with private investigators, bankruptcy monitoring, and legal resources to find assets and debtors that standard methods miss. Many of our customers use Deep Skip specifically for high-dollar charge-offs where the potential recovery justifies extraordinary measures. We're also often faster than internal legal processes because we coordinate all the investigative resources for you. Plus, if we locate the vehicle or significant assets, it can transform a total loss into a partial recovery. Would it make sense to identify your top 10 charged-off accounts by deficiency balance and see if Deep Skip could provide ROI on those specific accounts?"

**Key Points:**
- Economics: 30-40% recovery on $15K deficiency = significant value
- Deep Skip for high-dollar deficiencies
- Faster than internal legal processes
- Transforms total loss to partial recovery
- Coordinate resources (PI, legal, bankruptcy)
- Offer targeted pilot on highest-value charge-offs
- ROI analysis on specific accounts
