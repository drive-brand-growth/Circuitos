# Framework Routing Guide
## When to Use Brunson vs Schwartz vs StoryBrand vs Hormozi

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** November 1, 2025
**Master Copywriter:** 4 World-Class Frameworks

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The 4 Frameworks

### 1. **Russell Brunson** - Hook, Story, Offer
**Best for:** Direct response, urgency, high-intent leads

**Structure:**
- **Hook:** Interrupt pattern, grab attention
- **Story:** Build connection, transformation
- **Offer:** Clear value prop, easy next step

**When to use:**
- Product Aware (61-80 LPR)
- Most Aware (81-100 LPR)
- Short-form copy (100-150 words)
- Email subject lines
- Ads with clear CTA

**Example:**
```
HOOK: "Tired of gyms where they freak out when you drop 405?"

STORY: "Last month, Sarah joined MetroFlex. She was stuck at a
        315lb deadlift for 2 years. Three months with us?
        She pulled 405 at USAPL nationals."

OFFER: "First week free. Train with us, see if you fit.
        [Book Your Free Week]"
```

### 2. **Eugene Schwartz** - 5 Levels of Awareness
**Best for:** Audience segmentation, awareness-based messaging

**Levels:**
1. **Unaware (0-20):** Problem identification
2. **Problem Aware (21-40):** Agitate problem
3. **Solution Aware (41-60):** Differentiation
4. **Product Aware (61-80):** Overcome objections
5. **Most Aware (81-100):** Direct offer

**When to use:**
- ANY awareness level (it's the baseline framework)
- Segmented campaigns
- Multi-touch sequences
- Adjusting copy to lead temperature

**Example (Solution Aware):**
```
"You've tried commercial gyms (Planet Fitness, LA Fitness,
24 Hour Fitness). They're fine for cardio bunnies.

But serious lifters need:
â†’ Competition equipment (not machines)
â†’ Community of other serious lifters
â†’ Coaches who actually understand progressive overload

That's MetroFlex. Not for everyone. For you."
```

---

### 3. **Donald Miller** - StoryBrand (7-Part Framework)
**Best for:** Trust-building, positioning as guide, cold leads

**Structure:**
1. **Character (Hero):** Your customer
2. **Has a Problem:** External, Internal, Philosophical
3. **Meets a Guide:** You (show empathy + authority)
4. **Who Gives a Plan:** 3 simple steps
5. **Calls to Action:** Direct + Transitional
6. **Avoid Failure:** Stakes
7. **Ends in Success:** Vision

**When to use:**
- Solution Aware (41-60 LPR) - need to trust you
- Cold email leads (you're unknown)
- Longer-form copy (200-300 words)
- Educational content
- Building authority
- When trust is the bottleneck

**Example:**
```
CHARACTER:
"You're a serious lifter who's tired of commercial gyms
where people hog the squat rack for Instagram selfies."

PROBLEM:
External: Need real equipment, not Smith machines
Internal: Feel judged for grunting, using chalk
Philosophical: Believe serious training deserves serious environment

GUIDE:
"We get it. We've trained 100+ competitive lifters.
47 guys who pull 500+ train here. 3 hit PRs at nationals last month."

PLAN:
Step 1: Book a free week
Step 2: Train with us, meet the community
Step 3: Decide if you fit (no pressure)

CALL TO ACTION:
Direct: "Book Your Free Week"
Transitional: "Download our powerlifting program guide"

FAILURE:
"Don't waste another year in a gym that doesn't understand
progressive overload. Stop training alone."

SUCCESS:
"Imagine hitting a new PR every month. Picture yourself
on the platform at nationals with your training partners
cheering you on. That's what we do here."
```

### 4. **Alex Hormozi** - $100M Offers Value Equation
**Best for:** High-ticket, value stacking, removing objections

**Formula:**
```
Value = (Dream Outcome Ã— Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay Ã— Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**When to use:**
- Most Aware (81-100 LPR) - ready to buy
- High-ticket offers ($200+/mo)
- Overcoming price objections
- Stacking bonuses/guarantees
- Short, punchy copy

**Example:**
```
MAXIMIZE DREAM OUTCOME:
"Add 50lbs to your deadlift in 12 weeks"

MAXIMIZE PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD:
"3 members hit PRs at nationals last month"
"We've trained 47 guys who pull 500+"

MINIMIZE TIME DELAY:
"See results in your first 2 weeks"
"PR within 30 days or we write your next program free"

MINIMIZE EFFORT:
"We handle all programming - you just show up and lift"
"Open 24/7 - train when it fits your schedule"

RESULT = MASSIVE VALUE:
"$60/mo. No contract. Cancel anytime."
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Framework Combinations (Advanced)

### Example 1: Product Aware + Website Traffic + Email

**Best Combo:** Brunson (primary) + Hormozi (value stack in P.S.)

```
Subject: Marcus - saw you checking out MetroFlex pricing
[Brunson Hook]

Marcus,

Noticed you were on our site looking at pricing.
You're 1.8 miles away.
[Brunson Story - Brief transformation]

Quick answer: $60/mo, no contract, 24/7 access.

But here's what makes us different:
â†’ 47 guys who pull 500+ train here
â†’ 3 members hit PRs at nationals last month
â†’ Actual powerlifting equipment (Rogue, Eleiko)
[Brunson Offer + Social Proof]

First week free. Train Monday - 2 spots left this week.

[Book Free Week]

- Jake

P.S. Train with us for 30 days - if you don't hit a PR,
we'll write your next program free.
[Hormozi - Minimize risk, maximize likelihood]
```

### Example 2: Solution Aware + Cold Email + Email

**Best Combo:** StoryBrand (primary) + Schwartz (differentiation)

```
Subject: John - for serious lifters only

John,

Thanks for replying!
[Acknowledge cold email reply]

You mentioned you're tired of commercial gyms. We get it.
[StoryBrand - Empathy]

Most gyms cater to people doing bicep curls and treadmill walks.
We don't. Our members average:
â†’ Deadlift: 465lbs
â†’ Squat: 385lbs
â†’ Bench: 275lbs
[StoryBrand - Authority]

Not because we have magic equipment. Because serious lifters
attract serious lifters.
[Schwartz - Differentiation: WHY we're different]

Here's the plan:
1. Book a free week
2. Train with us, meet the community
3. Decide if you fit
[StoryBrand - Clear Plan]

No pressure. If you don't, no hard feelings.
If you do, welcome to the pack.

[Book Free Week]

- Jake
MetroFlex Arlington

P.S. Open 24/7. Deadlift platforms available even at 2am.
Because real lifters don't train 9-5.
[StoryBrand - Success Vision]
```

### Example 3: Most Aware + Website Traffic + SMS

**Best Combo:** Hormozi ONLY (pure value equation)

```
Marcus - you're 1.8mi away. $60/mo, no contract.
Add 50lbs to your deadlift in 12 weeks or we write
your next program free. First week free. Book now:

## ðŸš€ AI Routing Logic (Automatic)

The Master Copywriter automatically selects framework based on:

```javascript
// Simplified routing logic:

if (awareness_level === 'Unaware' || awareness_level === 'Problem Aware') {
  primary_framework = 'Schwartz';
  secondary_framework = lead_source === 'cold_email' ? 'StoryBrand' : 'Brunson';
}

else if (awareness_level === 'Solution Aware') {
  primary_framework = lead_source === 'cold_email' ? 'StoryBrand' : 'Schwartz';
  secondary_framework = 'Brunson';
}

else if (awareness_level === 'Product Aware') {
  primary_framework = 'Brunson';
  secondary_framework = 'Hormozi';
}

else if (awareness_level === 'Most Aware') {
  primary_framework = 'Hormozi';
  secondary_framework = 'Brunson';
}

// Channel overrides:
if (channel === 'sms') {
  primary_framework = 'Hormozi'; // Must be short
}

if (channel === 'linkedin') {
  primary_framework = 'StoryBrand'; // Professional trust-building
}

// Lead source overrides:
if (lead_source === 'cold_email' && awareness_level !== 'Most Aware') {
  add_storybrand_elements = true; // Always include trust-building
}
```

## ðŸŽ“ Advanced: Mixing Frameworks in Single Copy

**Best Practice:** Use ONE primary framework, borrow elements from others

**Example (Brunson primary + StoryBrand elements + Hormozi close):**

```
Subject: Marcus - for guys who pull 500+
[Brunson Hook]

Marcus,

You're a serious lifter stuck in a commercial gym.
We've been there.
[StoryBrand - Empathy]

Last month, 3 of our members hit PRs at USAPL nationals.
Sarah pulled 405. Mike squatted 500. Dave benched 350.
[Brunson Story - Transformation examples]

They didn't get there alone. They trained with 47 other
guys who pull 500+. Community matters.
[StoryBrand - Guide + Authority]

Here's how it works:
1. Book free week
2. Train with us
3. Decide if you fit
[StoryBrand - Plan]

$60/mo. No contract. PR in 30 days or we write your next
program free.
[Hormozi - Value equation + Risk reversal]

[Book Your Free Week]

You ready?

- Jake

P.S. You're 1.8 miles away. 2 spots left this week.
[Hormozi - Urgency + Scarcity]
```
