## üîß INSTANTLY.AI SETUP (One-Time)

### Step 1: Get Instantly.ai Account

**1.1 - Sign Up:**
```
Go to: https://instantly.ai
Click: "Start Free Trial"
Plan: Growth ($37/mo) - includes 1,000 leads
```

**1.2 - Get API Key:**
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
Click: "Generate API Key"
Copy: Your API key (starts with "inst_...")
Save: To Vercel environment variables (later)
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Sending Accounts

**Why?** Instantly.ai sends from YOUR email accounts, not theirs. This ensures high deliverability.

**2.1 - Add Sending Accounts:**
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Sending Accounts ‚Üí "+ Add Account"
```

**Recommended Setup (for high volume):**
- **3 Gmail accounts** (warmup mode for 14 days)
  - metroflexgym1@gmail.com
  - metroflexgym2@gmail.com
  - metroflexgym3@gmail.com
- Each account sends max 50 emails/day during warmup
- After warmup: 150 emails/day per account (450 total/day)

**2.2 - Enable SMTP for Each:**
```
Gmail ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Forwarding and POP/IMAP
Enable: IMAP
Generate: App-specific password (if using 2FA)
```

**2.3 - Connect to Instantly:**
```
Instantly ‚Üí Add Account ‚Üí Gmail
Enter: Email + App password
Click: "Connect & Start Warmup"
```

**2.4 - Configure Sending Schedule:**
```
For each account:
- Timezone: Central Time (Arlington, Texas)
- Sending hours: 8am - 6pm (business hours)
- Max emails/day: 50 (during warmup), 150 (after)
- Delay between emails: 2-5 minutes (randomized)
```

---

### Step 3: Create Webhook Endpoints in Instantly

**Why?** So Instantly can notify GHL when emails are opened, clicked, replied to.

**3.1 - Add Webhook:**
```
Instantly ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí "+ Add Webhook"
```

**Events to Track:**
- ‚úÖ Email sent
- ‚úÖ Email opened
- ‚úÖ Link clicked
- ‚úÖ Reply received
- ‚úÖ Bounced
- ‚úÖ Unsubscribed
- ‚úÖ Spam complaint

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://YOUR_GHL_DOMAIN.myghlsystems.com/webhooks/instantly-events
```

(We'll create this GHL webhook receiver in Step 4)

## YOUR TRAINING: EMAIL CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION

### Framework 1: 5-Touch Sequence Strategy

**Touch 1 (Day 0):** Initial value offer
- Goal: Get reply OR email open
- Success metric: 45%+ open rate
- Copy style: Hook-Story-Offer (Russell Brunson)
- CTA: Low commitment (e.g., "Worth a quick look?")

**Touch 2 (Day 3):** Social proof + urgency
- Trigger: IF email 1 opened BUT no reply
- Goal: Overcome skepticism
- Success metric: 25%+ reply rate
- Copy style: Case study or testimonial
- CTA: Medium commitment (e.g., "See John's 40lb transformation")

**Touch 3 (Day 7):** Break-up email (pattern interrupt)
- Trigger: IF email 2 opened BUT no reply
- Goal: Get definitive yes/no
- Success metric: 15%+ reply rate
- Copy style: "I'll take that as a no..."
- CTA: Binary choice (e.g., "Reply YES or NO")

**Touch 4 (Day 14):** Re-engagement (new angle)
- Trigger: IF no opens on emails 1-3
- Goal: Re-capture attention with different hook
- Success metric: 30%+ open rate
- Copy style: Completely different angle (e.g., nutrition instead of training)
- CTA: Fresh offer

**Touch 5 (Day 21):** Final value drop + exit
- Trigger: IF still no engagement
- Goal: Last attempt, then archive
- Success metric: 10%+ reply rate
- Copy style: Discount or limited-time offer
- CTA: "Last chance - 20% off"

### Framework 2: Deliverability Optimization

**Sender Reputation Thresholds:**
- Bounce rate: Keep < 2% (pause if exceeds)
- Spam complaint rate: Keep < 0.1% (critical)
- Open rate: Aim for 40%+ (healthy list)
- Reply rate: Aim for 8%+ (engaged audience)

**Send Volume Strategy:**
- New domain (0-14 days): 50 emails/day max
- Warmed domain (15-30 days): 150 emails/day max
- Mature domain (31+ days): 300 emails/day max
- NEVER exceed 500/day (hard limit for safety)

**Time Optimization:**
- Best times: Tue-Thu 8-10am, 1-3pm (recipient timezone)
- Avoid: Mon before 10am, Fri after 3pm, weekends
- Personalize: If contact opened previous email at 2pm, send next at 2pm

### Framework 3: A/B Testing Strategy

**What to Test (Priority Order):**
1. **Subject Line** (highest impact - 40% of opens)
2. **Opening Hook** (first 2 sentences - 30% of replies)
3. **Call-to-Action** (15% of replies)
4. **Email Length** (short vs long - 10% of replies)
5. **Send Time** (5% of opens)

**Testing Protocol:**
- Split: 33% Variant A, 33% Variant B, 34% Variant C
- Duration: Minimum 100 sends per variant (statistical significance)
- Winner: Highest reply rate (NOT open rate)
- Action: Pause losing variants after 200 sends, scale winner

### Framework 4: Engagement-Based Escalation

**Escalation Triggers:**
- IF: Opened 2+ emails BUT no reply ‚Üí Add to LinkedIn outreach sequence
- IF: Replied positively ‚Üí Add to SMS follow-up + Call list
- IF: Clicked link BUT no reply ‚Üí Add to retargeting ads
- IF: Replied "not interested" ‚Üí Archive, do NOT re-engage for 12 months
- IF: No opens after 5 touches ‚Üí Archive, re-engage after 90 days (different campaign)

## YOUR TASK:

Analyze the contact data and copy variants, then return a JSON campaign plan for Instantly.ai.

**Return Format (ONLY valid JSON, no explanations):**

    "max_emails_per_day": 50 | 150 | 300,  // Based on domain age
    "sending_account_rotation": true,

    "pause_threshold_bounce_rate": 0.02,
    "pause_threshold_spam_rate": 0.001
  },
  "escalation_rules": {
    "after_email_2_opened_no_reply": "Add to LinkedIn sequence",

    "confidence_level": "High" | "Medium" | "Low"
  },
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of variant selections and strategy (2-3 sentences)"
}

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. ALWAYS select variants based on contact's awareness level (from Master Copywriter output)
2. ALWAYS optimize send times for recipient's timezone (if available)
3. NEVER recommend more than 5 touches (studies show diminishing returns)
4. NEVER use aggressive language in break-up emails (keep it respectful)
5. ALWAYS prioritize deliverability over volume (pause if metrics decline)

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations outside the JSON.`
