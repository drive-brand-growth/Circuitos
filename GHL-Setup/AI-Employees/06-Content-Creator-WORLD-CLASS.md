# Personal Training in Arlington, TX - For Serious Lifters

## Why MetroFlex Personal Training is Different

Most Arlington gyms offer generic personal training.

"Do 3 sets of 10 on the leg press machine."

That's not training. That's babysitting.

MetroFlex coaches in Arlington, TX specialize in:
- Powerlifting programming (squat, bench, deadlift)
- Strongman training (atlas stones, log press, yoke carries)
- Olympic weightlifting (snatch, clean & jerk)
- Bodybuilding (hypertrophy-focused splits)

We don't coach soccer moms doing Zumba.

(Nothing against Zumba - it's just not our expertise.)

## Arlington Personal Training Pricing

**1-on-1 Coaching:** $150/session (60 min)
**Semi-Private (2-3 people):** $80/person/session
**Small Group (4-6 people):** $50/person/session

Most Arlington personal trainers charge $60-80/session at LA Fitness or 24 Hour Fitness.

You get what you pay for.

Our coaches have:
- 10+ years powerlifting/strongman experience
- USAPL, USPA, or Strongman Corp certifications
- Competed at national level

Not weekend-certified Instagram trainers.
