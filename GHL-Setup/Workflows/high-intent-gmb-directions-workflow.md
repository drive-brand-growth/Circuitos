# GHL Workflow: High-Intent GMB Directions Leads (Score 85+)
## Ultra-Hot Leads Ready to Visit - Immediate Multi-Touch Sequence

**Scenario:** Lead clicked "Get Directions" on Google My Business listing and has Virtual LPR score 85+
**Strategy:** Strike while hot - immediate SMS → Email if no response → Sales call if still no response
**Timeline:** 0min → 2hrs → 24hrs escalation
**Expected Conversion:** 65-80% (high-intent signal + proximity)

## 📋 COMPLETE WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION

### STEP 1: TRIGGER

**Trigger Type:** Custom Field Updated + Tag Added (OR condition)

```json
{
  "trigger_1": {
    "type": "custom_field_updated",
    "field": "lpr_score",
    "condition": "greater_than_or_equal",
    "value": 85
  },
  "trigger_2": {
    "type": "tag_added",
    "tag": "vlpr_gmb_directions_85plus"
  },
  "logic": "OR"
}
```

**Filter (AND conditions):**
- `custom_fields.intent_signal` contains "GMB_DIRECTIONS"
- `custom_fields.lpr_score` >= 85
- `custom_fields.distance_miles` <= 5 (within reasonable driving distance)

---

### STEP 2: VALIDATE WITH LEAD SCORER AGENT

**Purpose:** Confirm score is still valid (lead might have cooled off)

**Action Type:** Webhook
**Name:** "Lead Scorer - Validate High Intent"
**URL:** `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/claude-agent-memory`
**Method:** POST
**Headers:**
```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "action": "score-lead",
  "contactId": "{{contact.id}}",
  "businessId": "{{business.id}}",
  "useMemory": true,
  "data": {
    "contact": {
      "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}",
      "last_name": "{{contact.last_name}}",
      "email": "{{contact.email}}",
      "phone": "{{contact.phone}}",
      "city": "{{contact.city}}",
      "state": "{{contact.state}}",
      "custom_fields": {
        "distance_miles": "{{contact.custom_fields.distance_miles}}",
        "median_income": "{{contact.custom_fields.median_income}}",
        "neighborhood": "{{contact.custom_fields.neighborhood}}",
        "intent_signal": "GMB_DIRECTIONS_CLICKED",
        "vlpr_source": "google_my_business",
        "lpr_score": "{{contact.custom_fields.lpr_score}}",
        "conversation_turns": "{{contact.custom_fields.conversation_turns}}"
      }
    },
    "business": {
      "name": "{{business.name}}",
      "category": "{{business.category}}",
      "location": "{{business.address}}",
      "phone": "{{business.phone}}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Store Response In Custom Fields:**
- `{{webhook_response.total_score}}` → `lpr_score` (refresh score)
- `{{webhook_response.grade}}` → `lpr_grade`
- `{{webhook_response.confidence}}` → `agent_confidence`
- `{{webhook_response.next_action}}` → `last_agent_action`
- `{{webhook_response.metadata.conversationTurns}}` → `conversation_turns`

---

### STEP 3: CONDITIONAL BRANCH - CONFIRM STILL HOT

**If/Else Condition:**
```
IF webhook_response.total_score >= 80
  AND webhook_response.next_action = "IMMEDIATE_COLD_EMAIL" OR "IMMEDIATE_CALL"
  AND webhook_response.confidence = "VERY_HIGH" OR "HIGH"
THEN
  → Continue to STEP 4 (Send SMS)
ELSE
  → Exit workflow (lead cooled off, add to nurture instead)
```

---

### STEP 4: IMMEDIATE SMS (Within 5 Minutes)

**Action Type:** SMS
**Delay:** Immediate (no wait)

**SMS Template (Dynamic - Generated by Agent):**

**Option A: Use Pre-Written SMS**
```
Hi {{contact.first_name}}!

Saw you looked up directions to {{business.name}} 🗺️

We're only {{custom_fields.distance_miles}} miles from you at {{business.address}}.

Free first session if you come by today or tomorrow. Want me to text you the best times?

Reply YES and I'll send them over 👍

- {{business.owner_first_name}}
{{business.phone}}
```

**Option B: Agent-Generated SMS (More Personalized)**

Add another webhook before SMS:

**Webhook Action:**
**URL:** `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/claude-agent-memory`
**Body:**
```json
{
  "action": "generate-copy",
  "contactId": "{{contact.id}}",
  "businessId": "{{business.id}}",
  "useMemory": true,
  "data": {
    "contact": {
      "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}",
      "city": "{{contact.city}}",
      "custom_fields": {
        "distance_miles": "{{custom_fields.distance_miles}}",
        "intent_signal": "GMB_DIRECTIONS_CLICKED"
      }
    },
    "channel": "SMS",
    "awareness_level": "Most Aware",
    "business": {
      "name": "{{business.name}}",
      "category": "{{business.category}}",
      "address": "{{business.address}}",
      "owner_first_name": "{{business.owner_first_name}}"
    }
  }
}
```

Then use: `{{webhook_response.variants[0].body}}`

**After SMS Sent:**
- Add tag: "High Intent - SMS Sent"
- Update custom field: `last_contact_date` = NOW()
- Update custom field: `last_contact_channel` = "SMS"

---

### STEP 5: WAIT FOR SMS ENGAGEMENT

**Action Type:** Wait for Engagement
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Engagement Type:** SMS Reply

---

### STEP 6: CONDITIONAL - CHECK SMS RESPONSE

**If/Else Condition:**
```
IF contact.replied_to_sms = YES
  OR contact.sms_engagement = "POSITIVE"
THEN
  → Go to STEP 7A (SMS Reply - Book Them)
ELSE
  → Go to STEP 7B (No Reply - Send Email)
```

---

### STEP 7A: SMS REPLY PATH - BOOK APPOINTMENT

**Action Type:** SMS Response
```
Awesome {{contact.first_name}}! 🎉

Here are our best times this week:
- Tomorrow at 6am, 12pm, 6pm
- Friday at 6am, 12pm, 6pm

Click here to grab your spot: {{booking_link}}

Or reply with a time that works better for you!

Can't wait to meet you!
- {{business.owner_first_name}}
```

**Then:**
- Add tag: "HOT - Replied to SMS"
- Add to pipeline: "Virtual LPR - High Intent" → Stage: "Engaged - Booking"
- Create task for sales rep: "Follow up with {{contact.first_name}} - they replied to SMS!"
- **Record Positive Feedback** (see STEP 10)

**END WORKFLOW** (success path)

---

### STEP 7B: NO SMS REPLY - SEND EMAIL

**Action Type:** Webhook (Call Copywriter Agent)

**URL:** `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/claude-agent-memory`
**Body:**
```json
{
  "action": "generate-copy",
  "contactId": "{{contact.id}}",
  "businessId": "{{business.id}}",
  "useMemory": true,
  "data": {
    "contact": {
      "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}",
      "last_name": "{{contact.last_name}}",
      "city": "{{contact.city}}"
    },
    "channel": "EMAIL",
    "awareness_level": "Solution Aware",
    "context": "Lead clicked GMB directions but didn't reply to SMS. Escalating to email.",
    "business": {
      "name": "{{business.name}}",
      "category": "{{business.category}}",
      "address": "{{business.address}}"
    }
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL:** Agent will see that SMS was already sent (from conversation history) and adjust email accordingly!

**Then Send Email:**
- **To:** `{{contact.email}}`
- **Subject:** `{{webhook_response.variants[0].subject}}`
- **Body:** `{{webhook_response.variants[0].body}}`

**After Email Sent:**
- Add tag: "High Intent - Email Sent (No SMS Reply)"
- Update `last_contact_channel` = "EMAIL"

---

### STEP 8: WAIT FOR EMAIL ENGAGEMENT

**Action Type:** Wait
**Duration:** 24 hours

---

### STEP 9: CONDITIONAL - CHECK EMAIL RESPONSE

**If/Else Condition:**
```
IF contact.last_email_opened = YES
  OR contact.last_email_clicked = YES
  OR contact.replied = YES
THEN
  → Go to STEP 9A (Email Engaged - Manual Outreach)
ELSE
  → Go to STEP 9B (No Response - Create Sales Task)
```

---

### STEP 9A: EMAIL ENGAGED - CREATE PRIORITY TASK

**Action Type:** Create Task
```
Task Title: "CALL NOW - {{contact.first_name}} {{contact.last_name}} - HIGH INTENT"

Description:
🔥 ULTRA HOT LEAD - LPR Score: {{custom_fields.lpr_score}}

What they did:
✓ Clicked directions on GMB
✓ Opened our follow-up email
✓ Distance: {{custom_fields.distance_miles}} miles away

Timeline:
- Directions clicked: {{custom_fields.vlpr_signal_detected_date}}
- SMS sent: {{custom_fields.last_contact_date}}
- Email opened: {{contact.last_email_opened_date}}

Action: CALL THEM NOW - they're ready to visit!

Phone: {{contact.phone}}
Email: {{contact.email}}
```

**Assign To:** Sales Rep (or Business Owner)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Due Date:** Within 2 hours

**Then:**
- Add tag: "HOT - Email Engaged - Call Needed"
- Add to pipeline: "Virtual LPR - High Intent" → Stage: "Engaged - Call Scheduled"

---

### STEP 9B: NO RESPONSE - FINAL ATTEMPT

**Action Type:** Create Task
```
Task Title: "Follow-up Call - {{contact.first_name}} {{contact.last_name}}"

Description:
⚠️ HIGH INTENT BUT NO RESPONSE

What happened:
✓ LPR Score 85+ (clicked GMB directions)
✓ SMS sent - no reply
✓ Email sent - no open/click
✓ Distance: {{custom_fields.distance_miles}} miles

Recommendation:
- Try calling (they might prefer phone)
- Or move to passive retargeting

Phone: {{contact.phone}}
Email: {{contact.email}}
```

**Assign To:** Sales Rep
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Due Date:** Within 48 hours

**Then:**
- Add tag: "High Intent - No Response (SMS+Email)"
- Add to pipeline: "Virtual LPR - High Intent" → Stage: "No Response - Manual Outreach"

---

### STEP 10: WAIT FOR OUTCOME (48 Hours)

**Action Type:** Wait
**Duration:** 48 hours

---

### STEP 11: RECORD ML FEEDBACK

**Purpose:** Train the ML model - did this high-intent lead actually convert?

**Action Type:** Webhook
**URL:** `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/claude-agent-memory`
**Method:** POST

**Body:**
```json
{
  "action": "record-feedback",
  "contactId": "{{contact.id}}",
  "businessId": "{{business.id}}",
  "data": {
    "conversationId": "conv-{{contact.id}}",
    "predicted": "HIGH_INTENT",
    "actual": "{{contact.custom_fields.actual_outcome}}",
    "learnedPatterns": {
      "signals": [
        "GMB_DIRECTIONS_CLICKED",
        "PROXIMITY_{{contact.custom_fields.distance_miles}}MI",
        "SCORE_{{contact.custom_fields.lpr_score}}"
      ],
      "worked": "{{contact.booked_appointment}}",
      "responded_to_sms": "{{contact.replied_to_sms}}",
      "responded_to_email": "{{contact.last_email_opened}}",
      "industry": "{{business.category}}",
      "neighborhood": "{{contact.custom_fields.neighborhood}}",
      "income_bracket": "{{contact.custom_fields.median_income}}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Set `actual_outcome` based on contact status:**
```
IF contact.booked_appointment = YES
  → Set custom_fields.actual_outcome = "CONVERTED"

ELSE IF contact.replied_to_sms = YES OR contact.last_email_clicked = YES
  → Set custom_fields.actual_outcome = "HIGH_ENGAGEMENT"

ELSE IF contact.last_email_opened = YES
  → Set custom_fields.actual_outcome = "SOME_RESPONSE"

ELSE
  → Set custom_fields.actual_outcome = "NO_RESPONSE"
```

**This feedback teaches the system:**
- Are GMB directions clicks really as valuable as we think? (85+ LPR score)
- Does SMS work better than email for this signal?
- Should we adjust timing (2hrs vs 4hrs wait)?
- Are certain neighborhoods/income brackets more responsive?

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Success Metrics:
- **SMS Reply Rate:** 25-35% (high-intent signal)
- **Email Open Rate:** 45-60% (if SMS didn't convert)
- **Overall Conversion:** 65-80% book appointment or visit
- **Time to Convert:** 80% within 48 hours

### What the ML Loop Learns:
1. **Signal Strength:** Is GMB directions + 85 LPR really predictive?
2. **Channel Preference:** SMS vs Email for local fitness leads
3. **Timing:** 2hrs vs 4hrs vs 24hrs between touches
4. **Geographic Patterns:** Which neighborhoods convert best
5. **Income Correlation:** Does median income affect conversion?

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Time of Day Matters**
   - GMB directions clicked 5-7pm? They might visit tonight - SMS ASAP
   - Clicked 9am? They're planning ahead - email works better

2. **Add Urgency**
   - "Only 3 spots left this week"
   - "Free session expires tomorrow"

3. **Personalize by Distance**
   - <1 mile: "We're literally 5 minutes from you"
   - 1-3 miles: "Quick 10-min drive from {{neighborhood}}"
   - 3-5 miles: "Worth the drive - here's why..."

4. **A/B Test SMS Copy**
   - Variant A: Casual ("Hey {{first_name}}!")
   - Variant B: Professional ("Hi {{first_name}},")
   - Let agent generate 3 variants, rotate them

5. **Monitor ML Feedback**
   - After 50 leads, check Supabase `agent_feedback` table
   - Look for patterns: "GMB directions + <1mi = 82% convert"
   - Adjust LPR scoring weights accordingly
