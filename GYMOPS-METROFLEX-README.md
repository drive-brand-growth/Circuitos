---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

❌ **Light mode** (gym operators work in dark gyms)
❌ **Vanity metrics** (show real churn rate, not "engagement score")
❌ **Complex workflows** (if it takes >3 clicks, redesign)
❌ **Corporate language** (say "member quit" not "churn event")
❌ **Fake data** (use real gym names/numbers in examples)
❌ **Over-automation** (some things need human touch - don't automate personal training)

## 🎯 STEVE JOBS QUALITY GATES

### The Gym Operator Test
1. Would a gym owner at 2am find this useful? ✅
2. Does it save time or just add complexity? ✅
3. Can they understand it without a manual? ✅
4. Does it look like a weapon or a dashboard? ✅

### The Brian Dobson Test
Show the feature to Brian (or imagine showing it):
- Would he say "This is exactly what we need"? ✅
- Or would he say "This is too complicated"? ❌

If Option 2 → Simplify until Option 1.

### The Metroflex Standard
Does this feature:
- ✅ Help gym operators focus on training (not admin)?
- ✅ Increase member retention (the #1 metric)?
- ✅ Make the gym money (ROI must be clear)?
- ✅ Look hardcore (not corporate SaaS)?
