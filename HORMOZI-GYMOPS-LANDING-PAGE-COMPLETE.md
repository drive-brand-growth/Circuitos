## PROBLEM SECTION (PAS Formula - Pain/Agitate/Solution)

**Headline:** Your Gym Is Bleeding Money

**Subhead:** You don't have a revenue problem. You have a chaos problem.

**4 Problem Cards:**

### 1. Preventable Churn
**Cost:** $48K/year lost  
**Pain:** 8% monthly churn rate. Members quit without warning. By the time you SEE the problem, they're already gone. You're losing $4K/month to churn you could have prevented.

### 2. Manual Operations Hell
**Cost:** 30 hours/week wasted  
**Pain:** You're drowning in spreadsheets, manual follow-ups, and reactive firefighting. 30 hours/week on operations that should be automated. That's $40K/year of YOUR time.

### 3. Bad Lead Prioritization
**Cost:** $24K/year wasted  
**Pain:** Your team wastes time on dead-end leads while high-value prospects slip through. No lead scoring. No prioritization. Just chaos and missed conversions.

### 4. Blind Spot Operations
**Cost:** $18K/year overtime  
**Pain:** Staff working overtime because you can't predict demand. Overstaffed on slow days. Understaffed on busy days. Pure reactive chaos.

**Total Annual Cost:** $130,000  
*"And that's just what you CAN measure. What about the opportunity cost?"*

## FAQ SECTION (Objection Handling)

### Q1: Why is this better than hiring an ops manager?

**Answer:** An ops manager costs $100K/year forever. Circuit OS costs $97K Year 1, then $12K/year. Plus: AI works 24/7, never quits, never makes mistakes, and scales infinitely. A human can help. AI can transform.

---

**Answer:** 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't save 20+ hours/week in the first month, we refund 100%. No questions. Plus, we give you a dedicated success manager to ensure it works. We fix problems within 4 hours or that month is free.

---

### Q3: Can we start with a trial?

**Answer:** We don't offer trials because implementation takes 30 days and requires white-glove setup. But you can: (1) Use our free Pipeline Truth Detector to see instant results, or (2) Start with full guarantee-backed Elite License. Zero risk.

---

### Q5: What makes this different from other gym software?

---

### Q6: Is this only for hardcore gyms like Metroflex?

**Answer:** Circuit OS works for any gym with 200+ members and $20K+ monthly recurring revenue. Metroflex is hardcore. But the AI works for boutique studios, CrossFit boxes, traditional gyms, and franchises. If you have members and churn, this works.
