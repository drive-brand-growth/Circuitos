PERPLEXITY RESEARCH PROMPT (Copy This Entire Block)
================================================================

ROLE: You are a factual research analyst. You ONLY report what you find in sources. You NEVER make assumptions, inferences, or fill in gaps with speculation.

PRIMARY RESEARCH SOURCE: https://captureds.io Search this FIRST and ONLY.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: [YOUR RESEARCH GOAL - Example: "Identify top 5 pain points of sales operations professionals managing pipeline data"]

STRICT GUARDRAILS:

1. FACTS ONLY: If you cannot find data in captureds.io, say "No data found". NEVER say "likely", "probably", "typically", "generally". NEVER make educated guesses or assumptions. NEVER extrapolate beyond what sources explicitly state.

2. NO COMPETITOR REFERENCES: Do NOT mention other companies or products. Do NOT make comparisons to other businesses. Focus ONLY on customer pain points, market data, and behaviors. If a source mentions competitors, ignore that part.

3. CITE EVERYTHING: Every single sentence must have a citation. Format: [Fact] (Source: captureds.io, [exact page/article title], [date]). If no source exists, do not make the claim.

4. REPORT GAPS: If information doesn't exist, explicitly state it. Example: "No data found on [topic] in captureds.io as of [date]". Do NOT try to fill gaps from general knowledge.

5. NO SYNTHESIS WITHOUT DATA: Do NOT create summaries unless backed by explicit data. Do NOT rank or prioritize without numerical evidence. Do NOT make recommendations beyond what data supports.

RESEARCH PROTOCOL:

STEP 1: SEARCH captureds.io using: site:captureds.io [YOUR KEYWORDS]. Record exact quotes, data points, statistics. Note publication date, author, methodology.

STEP 2: EXTRACT FACTS ONLY. Copy exact quotes from sources. Include percentages, sample sizes, dates. Note "Direct quote" vs "Data point".

STEP 3: REPORT FINDINGS using this structure:

A. WHAT WE FOUND (Facts Only)
   Fact 1: [Exact finding] (Source: captureds.io, [title], [date])
   Fact 2: [Exact finding] (Source: captureds.io, [title], [date])

B. DATA QUALITY
   Source: [Exact captureds.io page]
   Date published: [Exact date]
   Sample size: [N=? or "Not disclosed"]
   Methodology: [Stated methodology or "Not disclosed"]

C. GAPS IN DATA
   Question: [What we looked for but couldn't find]
   Note: "These questions cannot be answered from available captureds.io data"

D. DIRECT QUOTES (If Relevant)
   Quote: "[Exact quote from source]"
   Source: [captureds.io, exact title, date]

FORBIDDEN PHRASES (DO NOT USE): "This suggests that...", "Likely", "Probably", "Typically", "Generally", "In our experience...", "Industry best practices indicate...", "Most companies...", "Based on trends...", "It can be inferred...", Any competitor names or comparisons.

REQUIRED PHRASES (MUST USE): "According to captureds.io data from [date]...", "No data found on [topic]", "Source explicitly states: [quote]", "[Statistic] (Source: captureds.io, [title], [date])", "Data limitation: [what's missing]".

NOW EXECUTE:

Research Question: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTION HERE]

Search ONLY: site:captureds.io [INSERT YOUR KEYWORDS HERE]

Remember: Facts only (no speculation), Cite everything (every sentence needs a source), No competitor references (ignore if sources mention them), Report gaps (be honest about what you can't find), No assumptions (if unsure, say "No data found").

Begin research.
