## Platform Overview

### What is MuscleWare?

MuscleWare is the official contest software and registration platform for:
- **National Physique Committee (NPC)**
- **NPC Worldwide**
- **IFBB Professional League**
- **Canadian Physique Alliance (CPA)**

### Platform Statistics
- **20 languages** supported
- **89 countries** served
- **394 promoters** using the system
- **4,301+ events** managed

### Core Functionality

MuscleWare operates as a **360° turn-key system** managing the complete competition lifecycle:

1. **Competitor Registration** - Online forms with real-time validation
2. **Payment Processing** - Secure transactions flowing directly to promoters
3. **Athlete Check-In** - Pre-numbered competitors with auto-generated waivers
4. **Music Management** - MP3 upload for posing routines
5. **Scoring & Reporting** - Real-time statistician tools, scorecards, MC sheets

   - Use fade-in (1-2 seconds) at start
   - Use fade-out (2-3 seconds) at end

2. **Start Strong**
   - Music should start immediately or within 1 second
   - Choose an impactful opening (beat drop, vocal hook, etc.)

3. **Energy Throughout**
   - Maintain consistent energy level
   - Avoid slow/quiet sections unless intentional
   - Consider building to a climax at 45-50 seconds

4. **Clean Transitions**
   - If cutting/splicing multiple songs, use crossfades
   - Avoid abrupt cuts that sound unprofessional

5. **Appropriate Content**
   - Avoid excessive profanity (FCC regulations at some venues)

**Best Practice:** Upload music as soon as you register, even if you might change it later. You can always re-upload before the deadline.

### Troubleshooting Music Upload Issues

**Problem:** "File format not supported"
- **Solution:** Ensure file is MP3 format. Convert using Audacity or online converter.

**Problem:** "File too large"
- **Solution:** Reduce bitrate to 192 kbps or lower. Compress file size.

**Problem:** "Upload failed" or "Error uploading"
- **Solution:** Check internet connection. Try different browser. Clear cache/cookies. Reduce file size.

**Problem:** "Music doesn't play in preview"
- **Solution:** Upload may be incomplete. Try re-uploading. Test MP3 in separate media player first.

**Problem:** "I can't find the music upload section"
- **Solution:** You may be on the wrong page. Access your Athlete Profile via confirmation email link. Contact support@muscleware.com if issue persists.

**Still Having Issues?**
Email **support@muscleware.com** with:

A: Contact the promoter immediately. Name changes typically must be made at least 2 weeks before the show to ensure correct competitor certificates and documentation.

**Q: Can I compete in multiple divisions on the same day?**
A: YES, with one exception: Women's Fit Model competitors CANNOT compete in other divisions simultaneously.

**Q: I'm 17 but will turn 18 before the show. Can I register?**
A: It depends on the promoter's policy. Some allow registration if you'll be 18 by show day. Others require you to be 18 at time of registration. Contact the promoter directly to ask.

**Q: Do I need to upload a photo during registration?**
A: Photo requirements vary by promoter. Most do NOT require photos during initial registration. Some may request photos closer to show date via your Athlete Profile.

### Class Selection Questions

**Q: How do I know which class to enter?**
A: Base your class selection on:
- **Experience level:** True Novice (never competed) → Novice (limited experience) → Open (any experience)
- **Age:** Enter Masters class if you meet age requirement
- **Physical specifications:** Measure height/weight per division requirements
- **Eligibility:** Review Novice eligibility rules carefully

**Q: Can I enter both Novice and Open classes in the same division?**
A: YES. Many competitors enter both to maximize stage time and placement opportunities.

**Q: What's the difference between True Novice and Novice?**
A: **True Novice** = First-time competitor who has NEVER entered any NPC contest. **Novice** = Competitor who hasn't won an Overall, hasn't placed Top 10 at Nationals, and hasn't won an Open class with 3+ competitors.

**Q: I'm on the borderline between two height/weight classes. Which should I choose?**
A: Register for the class that matches your competition day weight/height. For Classic Physique, weigh yourself in morning (hydrated) to predict show weight. For height classes, measure accurately with shoes off.

**Q: What if there aren't enough competitors in my class?**
A: Promoters may combine classes if there are insufficient competitors (typically fewer than 3-5). You'll still compete and be eligible for awards. Combined classes will be clearly announced.

### Payment Questions

**Q: When do I pay for my registration?**
A: Payment is typically due IMMEDIATELY after submitting the registration form. You'll be directed to the payment page before your registration is confirmed.

**Q: What payment methods are accepted?**
A: Most contests accept credit/debit cards via Stripe or Square, and PayPal. Specific options depend on the promoter's payment gateway selection.

**Q: Can I pay in installments?**
A: Generally NO. Full payment is required at time of registration. Some promoters may offer payment plans for early registrations—contact them directly to ask.

**Q: Are there refunds if I can't compete?**
A: Refund policies are set by individual promoters (not MuscleWare). Most contests offer NO REFUNDS within 30 days of show. Check the specific contest's Terms of Use during registration.

**Q: I was charged twice. What do I do?**
A: Contact the promoter immediately with your transaction details. Also email support@muscleware.com with proof of duplicate charges.

### Music Questions

**Q: When should I upload my music?**
A: Upload as soon as possible after registration. Deadlines are typically 7-14 days before show, but early upload ensures you don't forget.

**Q: What if I want to change my music after uploading?**
A: You can re-upload music through your Athlete Profile until the music deadline. The newest upload replaces the previous one.

**Q: My division doesn't require music. Do I still upload something?**
A: Check your specific contest requirements. Some promoters request music from all competitors for potential posedown use. If optional, you can upload a favorite song just in case.

**Q: Can I use a song with profanity?**
A: Many venues have FCC regulations or family-friendly policies. Excessive profanity may result in your music being rejected. Use edited/clean versions when possible.

**Q: What happens if I don't upload music by the deadline?**
A: For divisions requiring music (Women's Fitness), you may be assessed a late fee ($25-50) or required to provide music on USB day-of-show. Repeated failure to upload may result in disqualification from routine round.

### NPC Membership Questions

**Q: Where do I get my NPC Member Number?**
A: Purchase NPC membership at npcnewsonline.com. You'll receive your member number via email after payment.

**Q: How much does NPC membership cost?**
A: NPC membership is typically $50-75 per year. Pricing may vary by region or membership type. Check npcnewsonline.com for current pricing.

**Q: My membership expired. Can I still register?**
A: NO. Your NPC membership must be ACTIVE at time of registration. Renew your membership before registering for contests.

**Q: I lost my NPC Member Number. How do I find it?**
A: Check your original NPC confirmation email. If lost, contact the NPC office at npcfirst@npcregistration.com with your name and email address used for membership purchase.

### Post-Registration Questions

**Q: I didn't receive a confirmation email. What do I do?**
A: First, check spam/junk folders. Search email for "MuscleWare" or contest name. If still not found, try re-registering with the SAME email/name (system will recognize existing registration). Last resort: email support@muscleware.com.

**Q: Can I add another class after I've already registered?**
A: YES. Use your Athlete Profile link from confirmation email. Click "Add Class" and complete payment for the additional division/class.

**Q: How do I know what time to arrive at the show?**
A: Your confirmation email and/or Athlete Profile will include show schedule details. Typically, check-in is 2-4 hours before prejudging. Confirm with promoter's website or pre-show email updates.

A: At athlete check-in on show day. Bring valid government ID matching your registration name. Check-in location and times are provided in confirmation email.

A: Generally NO. Athletes must check in personally with photo ID. Some promoters allow exceptions with advance notice and written authorization. Contact promoter to ask.
