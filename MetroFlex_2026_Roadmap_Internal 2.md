# METROFLEX 2026 ROADMAP
**Internal Planning Document**
*For: Brian & Noel*
*Date: January 2026*

---

## 1. TOP-LEVEL SUMMARY

### What We're Doing in 2026

MetroFlex is building a multi-vertical hardcore gym brand across four areas:
- **HQ Gym**: Little Havana location opens, grows to 625+ members
- **Apparel**: Launch Feb 15 with core collection, test demand, scale if proven
- **Licensing**: Sign 2-3 test gyms, build support systems, expand to 6-10 if successful
- **Events**: Host 1-2 competitions, integrate with apparel sales

### Why It Matters

We're not just opening a gym. We're building a brand with 38 years of heritage that can scale through licensing, apparel, and events. Each piece feeds the others.

### How Revenue Grows

**Year 1 Conservative Projections:**
- HQ Gym: $270K (400 members by Q4)
- Licensing: $120K-180K (2-3 gyms × $60K fees)
- Apparel: $50K-120K (testing phase)
- Events: $15K-30K (1-2 small events)
- **Total: $455K-600K**

**Year 2-3 Growth Path:**
- HQ Gym: $540K (750 members)
- Licensing: $360K-600K (6-10 gyms + royalties)
- Apparel: $200K-500K (proven demand, scaled inventory)
- Events: $100K-200K (3-4 regional events)
- **Total: $1.2M-1.8M**

### How They Support Each Other

**Gym → Licensing**: Proven unit economics show licensees this works. HQ is the proof of concept.

**Gym → Apparel**: Members are our first customers. Test products on people who already trust the brand.

**Apparel → Licensing**: Licensees get apparel line as part of their package. More gyms = more apparel distribution.

**Events → Everything**: Competitions bring in new members, sell apparel, attract licensee prospects, and build credibility.

**Licensing → Growth**: License fees fund expansion. Each gym brings 600-750 members into the MetroFlex ecosystem.

## 7. WHAT BRIAN NEEDS TO KNOW

### What's Happening

MetroFlex is transitioning from a single gym brand to a multi-vertical business. We're testing apparel, licensing, and events in 2026 while growing the HQ gym to profitability.

### What Matters Most

**Priority 1: Get Miami to 625 members** (break-even).
Everything else depends on this. If the HQ gym fails, licensing has no proof of concept.

**Priority 2: Validate apparel demand** (Feb-Jun).
If we can sell 500+ units in 6 months, it proves licensees will sell apparel too.

**Priority 3: Sign 2-3 test licensees** (Q2-Q3).
Build the playbook from real experience. Don't scale to 10 gyms until we know 2-3 can succeed.

### Where Brian Fits In

**Your Role:**
1. **Face of the brand**: You're the credibility. Licensees want to meet you.
2. **Licensing tours**: Every serious prospect visits Miami, you give the tour.
3. **Event appearances**: Photo ops, meet & greets, athlete relationships.
4. **Apparel billboard**: Wear the gear. Post on social. You are the marketing.

**What You Don't Do:**
- Daily gym operations (Noel handles)
- Apparel fulfillment (staff handles)
- Event logistics (delegated)

**Time Commitment:**
- Weeks 1-8: Heavy (gym opening, systems setup)
- Month 3+: 20-30 hours/week (licensing tours, content creation)

### What Decisions You Need to Approve

**Q1 Decisions:**
- Final apparel designs (Feb 1)
- Licensing pricing and terms (Feb 15)
- Event sponsorship deals ($5K-25K commitments)
- Hiring (any FT or PT staff)

**Q2 Decisions:**
- Each licensee approval (yes/no on specific prospects)
- Apparel expansion (order 1000+ units?)
- Events: Which ones to commit to for rest of year

**Q3-Q4 Decisions:**
- Hiring for 2027 (FT operations manager, licensing coordinator)
- 2027 expansion strategy (how many more licensees?)
- Facility expansion or second Miami location?

### What to Expect Financially

**2026 Cash Flow Reality:**

**Miami Gym:**
- Loses money for 18-20 months
- Requires $150K-200K additional capital (beyond $400K SBA)
- Brian salary: $3K/month Year 1 (low, by design)

**Licensing:**
- $120K-260K upfront fees (2-5 gyms)
- Covers apparel investment + events + shortfalls

**Apparel:**
- $15K-25K initial investment (Feb)
- $30K-60K additional inventory (if demand proven)
- Break-even by June, profitable by Q4

**Events:**
- $20K-40K total investment (4 events)
- Break-even goal via apparel sales + sponsorships

**Net 2026:**
- If conservative: $100K-150K net positive (licensing covers gym losses)
- If aggressive: $250K-350K net positive (5 licensees, strong apparel)

**2027 and Beyond:**
- Miami gym profitable Month 18-20
- Licensing scales (6-10 gyms = $360K-600K)
- Apparel proven and scaled ($200K-500K)
- Events self-sustaining ($100K-200K)
- **Total 2027 Target: $1M-1.5M revenue**

## FINAL WORDS FOR BRIAN

You've built something real over 38 years. This plan isn't about changing MetroFlex—it's about scaling what already works.

**Three Rules for 2026:**

1. **Prove it before you scale it**
   Test apparel with 200 units before ordering 2000.
   Launch 2 licensees before committing to 10.
   Run 1 event successfully before scheduling 4.

2. **Cash flow is king**
   Don't spend money you don't have.
   Licensing fees fund expansion.
   Profits from apparel cover event costs.

3. **You're the brand**
   Wear the gear. Show up at events. Give the tours.
   People don't license a system—they license YOU.

This roadmap is aggressive but doable. It requires focus, discipline, and saying "no" to distractions.

**Stay hardcore. Stay focused. Build the empire one rep at a time.**

**Metroflex 2026: Simple. Focused. Hardcore.**
