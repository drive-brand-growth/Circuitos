# Circuit OS: Quality Control Agent (QCA)
## The AI Supervisor That Monitors All Agents for Protocol Compliance

**The Problem with Multi-Agent Systems:**
- 10+ AI agents running simultaneously (Lead Qualifier, Retention Bot, Pricer, etc.)
- Each agent makes autonomous decisions
- No oversight = agents can drift from protocols
- Inconsistent quality across agents
- No validation that ML/DMN/LLM pipeline is working correctly

**Circuit OS Solution: Quality Control Agent (QCA)**
- Monitors ALL agent interactions in real-time
- Validates adherence to DMN rules, ML scoring, LLM outputs
- Checks protocol compliance with automated checklists
- Flags deviations, errors, and quality issues
- Generates quality reports and improvement recommendations
- **Result: Enterprise-grade AI governance, 99.5% protocol compliance**

### QCA Workflow (Step-by-Step)

**Example: Lead Qualification Agent Interaction**

**Step 1: Agent Action Triggered**
```
Lead fills out website form at 2:15 PM
→ Lead Qualification Agent activates
→ QCA starts monitoring
```

**Step 2: QCA Captures Agent Inputs**
```
QCA logs:
{
  "agent": "Lead Qualification Agent",
  "action": "Qualify new lead",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20 14:15:32",
  "input_data": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@ironworksgym.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
    "form_source": "Website - Contact Us",
    "message": "Interested in Circuit OS for my 3-location gym"
  }
}
```

**Step 3: QCA Monitors Agent Processing**
```
QCA watches:
✓ Agent asks 7 qualification questions via email
✓ Agent waits for responses (or uses available data)
✓ Agent extracts: budget ($2K-3K/mo), timeline (30 days), authority (owner)
✓ Agent runs sentiment analysis: "Positive, high intent"
✓ Agent feeds data to ML scoring model
```

**Step 4: QCA Validates ML Model**
```
QCA checks:
✓ ML model version: v2.3.1 (current) ✓
✓ Input features: All 12 required features present ✓
✓ Feature values: Within expected ranges ✓
✓ Model output: Lead score = 87/100 ✓
✓ Model confidence: 91% (> 75% threshold) ✓
```

**Step 5: QCA Validates DMN Rules**
```
QCA checks:
✓ DMN rule applied: "IF score > 80 → Tag: HOT" ✓
✓ Pipeline stage: "Sales - Discovery" ✓
✓ Assignment: Assigned to "Noel Pena" ✓
✓ Notification: Email sent to sales rep ✓
✓ Follow-up: Scheduled for next business day ✓
```

**Step 6: QCA Validates LLM Output (Personalized Email)**
```
Agent generates personalized email via LLM:

Subject: John - quick question about Iron Works Gym

Hi John,

Thanks for reaching out about Circuit OS! I saw you have 3 locations - that's impressive.

Quick question: are you currently using AI to qualify leads across all 3 locations, or is it manual follow-up?

I'd love to show you a quick demo of how Circuit OS could work for Iron Works Gym.

### QCA Failure Detection (Example)

**Example: Agent Makes Mistake**

**Scenario:** Dynamic Pricing Agent tries to raise price 35% (violates 20% safety rule)

**QCA Detection:**
```
Step 1: Agent proposes price change
  Current price: $99/month
  Proposed price: $134/month (35% increase)

Step 2: QCA validates DMN rules
  Rule: "Price change must be < 20% from current"
  Violation detected: 35% > 20% ✗

Step 3: QCA blocks action
  Status: FAILED
  Reason: "Exceeds 20% price change safety limit"
  Action: Block price change, alert admin

Step 4: QCA generates alert
  Priority: HIGH
  Subject: "Dynamic Pricing Agent attempted unsafe price change"
  Details:
    - Current: $99/mo
    - Proposed: $134/mo (35% increase)
    - Rule violated: Max 20% change
    - Member: Jane Doe (#4567)
    - Action: BLOCKED
    - Recommendation: "Review pricing model constraints"

Step 5: QCA logs incident
  {
    "agent": "Dynamic Pricing Agent",
    "interaction_id": "DPA-2025-10-20-042",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20 16:32:11",
    "action_attempted": "Price change",
    "status": "FAILED - BLOCKED",
    "violation_type": "DMN Rule Violation",
    "rule_violated": "Max 20% price change",
    "quality_score": 0,
    "action_taken": "Blocked, admin alerted",
    "recommendation": "Review and retrain pricing model"
  }
```

**Result:** Unsafe price change prevented, customer protected, issue logged for review.

## 🚨 REAL-TIME ALERTING SYSTEM

### QCA Alert Levels

**CRITICAL (Immediate Action):**
```
Trigger: Agent makes decision that could:
  - Harm customer (e.g., cancel service without consent)
  - Violate regulations (e.g., send email without unsubscribe)
  - Lose revenue (e.g., pricing error costing $10K+)
  - Damage brand (e.g., offensive content generation)

Action:
  1. BLOCK agent action immediately
  2. Send SMS + Email to admin
  3. Create urgent ticket
  4. Log to incident management system
  5. Disable agent until human review

Example Alert:
  🚨 CRITICAL: Voice AI Agent attempted to cancel member subscription without explicit consent
  Member: John Smith (#7845)
  Action: BLOCKED
  Requires: Immediate admin review
```

**MODERATE (Review Within 4 Hours):**
```
Trigger: Agent violates protocol but no immediate harm:
  - Exceeds safety constraints (e.g., 35% price increase vs 20% limit)
  - Low confidence decision (ML model < 75% confidence)
  - Missed escalation cue
  - Data quality issue

Action:
  1. Block action (if applicable)
  2. Email admin
  3. Create ticket for review
  4. Log for weekly review

Example Alert:
  ⚠️  MODERATE: Dynamic Pricing Agent attempted unsafe price change (35% increase, limit is 20%)
  Member: Jane Doe (#4567)
  Action: BLOCKED
  Requires: Review within 4 hours
```

**MINOR (Review Within 24 Hours):**
```
Trigger: Quality issue but no protocol violation:
  - Missing enrichment data
  - Slight delay in response time
  - Suboptimal LLM output (but acceptable)
  - Lower engagement than expected

Action:
  1. Log issue
  2. Include in daily report
  3. No immediate action needed
  4. Review during weekly QA meeting

Example Alert:
  ℹ️  MINOR: Lead Qualification Agent missing phone number enrichment for 1 lead
  Lead: Mike Johnson (#3421)
  Action: Flagged for follow-up enrichment
  Requires: Review within 24 hours
```

Step 3: Make.com sends to Claude AI API (QCA)
  Prompt:
  "You are the Quality Control Agent. Review this Lead Qualification Agent interaction and validate protocol compliance using the checklist. Return JSON with quality_score, issues, and recommendations."

Step 4: QCA (Claude AI) analyzes
  - Checks all 13 checklist items
  - Validates ML model, DMN rules, LLM output
  - Generates quality score and report

Step 5: QCA returns validation result
  {
    "quality_score": 100,
    "status": "PASSED",
    "checklist_complete": true,
    "issues": [],
    "protocol_violations": 0,
    "recommendation": "No action needed - agent performed flawlessly"
  }

Step 6: Make.com logs result to Supabase
  - Stores in QCA_logs table
  - Updates agent_performance_metrics
  - Adds to daily_report_queue

Step 7: If issues detected, send alert
  IF quality_score < 80 OR protocol_violations > 0:
    Send email/SMS alert to admin
    Create ticket in incident system
```

## 🎯 SUMMARY

**Quality Control Agent (QCA) = The AI Supervisor**

**What It Does:**
- Monitors ALL 10+ AI agents in real-time
- Validates every decision against DMN/ML/LLM protocols
- Runs automated checklists for each agent interaction
- Flags errors, violations, and quality issues
- Generates daily/weekly quality reports
- Provides improvement recommendations

**Why It's Critical:**
- Multi-agent systems need oversight (agents can drift)
- Enterprise customers require audit trails and governance
- Error prevention saves $45K-95K/year
- Quality improvement adds $30K-50K/year revenue
- Operational efficiency saves $44K/year
- **Total value: $119K-189K/year for $3,600/year cost**

**How It Works:**
1. Every agent action triggers QCA validation
2. QCA runs protocol checklist (DMN/ML/LLM)
3. QCA scores quality (0-100) and flags issues
