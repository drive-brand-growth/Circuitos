4. Click "New bucket"
5. Bucket name: `circuit-os-dashboards`
6. Public bucket: âœ… YES (for web hosting)
7. Click "Create bucket"

#### Step 2: Upload Files

**Upload these folders/files:**

1. **Root Files:**
   - `index.html`
   - `main-dashboard.html`
   - `circuit-animations.js`
   - `COLOR-PALETTE-GUIDE.html`

2. **Dashboards Folder** (entire folder):
   - `Dashboards/caio-university.html`
   - `Dashboards/interactive-demo.html`
   - `Dashboards/sales-team-dashboard.html`
   - `Dashboards/unified-demo-dashboard.html`
   - `Dashboards/lead-processing-demo.html`

3. **Brand-Assets Folder** (entire folder):

```

**Examples:**
- Main Dashboard: `https://xxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/circuit-os-dashboards/main-dashboard.html`

## Update HTML Files for Production (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain or CDN, update the paths in your HTML files:

### Update main-dashboard.html
Change iframe sources from:
```html
<iframe src="Dashboards/caio-university.html">
```

To:
```html
<iframe src="https://YOUR_PROJECT_URL/storage/v1/object/public/circuit-os-dashboards/Dashboards/caio-university.html">
```

## Bucket Configuration

### Recommended Settings
```
Bucket name: circuit-os-dashboards
Public: âœ… Yes
File size limit: 50MB
Allowed MIME types: */* (all types)

### Security Policies (RLS)
For public dashboards, use this policy:

```sql

CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING ( bucket_id = 'circuit-os-dashboards' );

-- Allow authenticated uploads (optional)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
